  <p class="mt2 drop-cap">THIS reprint is not a facsimile of the edition of 1584, for that was in
    black letter, and its page smaller and of quarto size. Being also for
    modern readers, and for use, the <i>i</i> of the original has become, where
    necessary, the <i>j</i> of the second edition; the <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> have been
    altered according to modern usage, that is, generally interchanged;
    while the short <i>s</i> replaces the <i>ſ</i>. Such modernisations render it
    more readable by the historical and philosophical student, by the
    man of science, and by the psychological physician, willing to learn
    all that may instruct himself and benefit others. Neither would this
    reprint have been undertaken, unless the work itself had appeared to
    my friend and fellow-student, W. T. Gairdner, M.D., LL.D., Professor
    of Medicine in the University of Glasgow,—and led by him—to myself and
    others, worthy on the above-mentioned grounds, of being reproduced, and
    as being both in matter and style a valuable English classic.</p>

  <p>While, however, it is not a facsimile, yet, excepting such variations
    as are above noticed, and allowing for the few and trifling errors from
    which no copy can expect to be free, not even a photographic one, as
    experts in these matters well know, this will, I believe, be found a
    correct reprint. Every proof has been thrice, and sometimes oftener,
    read over with the original by myself, and these efforts have been
    well supplemented by the intelligence and care of its printers. Even
    the word-errors of the original, where not in its list of errata, have
    been retained, though the true or conjectural readings have been given
    in the margin, or in two or three instances in the Notings at the end.
    Except also in two instances, where for necessity’s sake alterations
    have been introduced within []s, and the original given in the margin,
    the old punctuation has been retained, it being, as a rule, very good,
    while any slight slips are<span class="pagenum">viii</span>
    readily observed, and do not affect the
    sense. For such other differences as are due to the black letter, and
    for others like these, I would refer the print-studying reader to the
    Introduction.</p>

  <p>In the biographical portion of this Introduction, besides a supposition
    or two of my own, which from his writings seem to me highly probable,
    there have been given notices of his pedigree, age, and marriages,
    matters hitherto unknown or misstated, and for which I would at once
    record my indebtedness to Edmund Ward Oliver, Esq. This gentleman
    having taken an interest in investigating these questions, and being a
    perfect stranger to me, wrote and offered the results of his inquiries
    so soon as he had learnt that I was engaged with this reprint, and has
    since most obligingly answered the various questions that I have had
    occasion to put to him. A copy of Scot’s Will has been also for the
    first time published, and some Notes and a Glossary added. Were I to
    have imitated the learned editors of former days, I should have added,
    not some, but exhaustive notes on every point, gathered from every
    known and unknown source; but I have confined myself to explanation, or
    to making a few remarks on the text, giving also the author’s agreement
    with, or obligations to Wier, so far as I knew them, and Shakespeare’s
    and Middleton’s obligations to himself; my reason for not entering into
    greater details being that I am no student of the pseudo-science of
    witchcraft, but a student only of what is useful, and true, and good.</p>

  <p>It would be unseemly, especially after mentioning Mr. Oliver’s name,
    were I to close this without acknowledging the kind assistance of
    my well-known friend, James Gairdner, Esq., of the Public Record
    Office; of my Shakespearian friends, W. Aldis Wright, LL.D., and P.
    A. Daniel, Esq.; of that given me by the Very Reverend Father W. H.
    Eyre, lately Superior of Stonyhurst; by Mrs. Amelia Green; as also by
    Prof. W. W. Skeat, and Dr. J. A. H. Murray, in my Glossary; though all
    were, and personally are, strangers; as are Miss Kath. P. Woolrych,
    Oare Vicarage, Kent, and Miss Ayscough, of Brabourne Vicarage; and
    especially that given me by my other Shakespearian friends, the Rev.
    W. H. Harrison, of St. Anne’s, South Lambeth, and W. G. Stone, Esq.
    My best thanks are also due to Mr. J. J. Jervis for the use, for the
    printer, of a partially incomplete copy of the first
    <span class="pagenum">ix</span> edition; to the
    University of Glasgow for the loan, for my own use, for the greater
    part of a year, of another copy of this first edition; and for the
    use for the same period of a copy of the third edition to my Alma
    Mater of Edinburgh, endeared to me by the teachings, remembrances, and
    kindnesses of Sir William Hamilton, Allan Thomson, Christison, Traill,
    Jamieson, that most sagacious of surgeons and teachers, Syme, and the
    ever-to-be-revered physician and man, W. Pulteney Alison.</p>

  <p class="mt2 drop-cap">EXCEPT that they add the names of some who have opposed his views, or
    some such trifling matters, all the writers of biographical notices
    of Scot have drawn their information from the account given of him in
    Wood’s <i>Athenæ Oxon.</i> Nor, indeed, until lately, unless original search
    had been made, were other sources available. Hence I, in the first
    place, give his words verbatim from the edition of 1691.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“<span class="smcap">Reynolde Scot</span>, a younger Son of Sir <i>John Scot</i> of
      <i>Scots-hall</i>, near to <i>Smeeth</i> in <i>Kent</i>, by his Wife, Daughter
      of <i>Reynolde Pimp</i> of Pimps-court Knight, was born in that
      County, and at about 17 years of age was sent to <i>Oxon</i>,
      particularly, as it seems, to <i>Hart</i> hall, where several of
      his Country-men and name studied in the latter end of K. <i>Hen.
        8.</i> and in the Reign of <i>Ed. 6. &amp;c.</i> Afterwards he retired to
      his native Country without the honour of a degree, and settled
      at <i>Smeeth</i>, where he found great incouragement in his studies
      from his kinsman Sir <i>Thos. Scot</i>. About which time taking to
      him a Wife, he gave himself up solely to solid reading, to
      the perusing of obscure authors that had by the generality of
      Scholars been neglected, and at times of leisure to husbandry
      and gardening, as it may partly appear from these books
      following.</p>

    <p>“A perfect platform of a Hop-garden, and necessary instructions
      for the making and maintenance thereof, with notes and rules
      for reformation of all abuses, &amp;c. <i>Lond.</i> 1576. qu. the 2.
      edit. as it seems.</p>

    <p>“The discovery of Witchcraft; wherein the leud dealing of
      Witches, and Witchmongers is notably detected, the knavery of

  <p class="noindent">But as the first part of the ancestry given in this book is not
    supported by anything beyond possibility and legend, so this latter
    portion is incorrect in various particulars. Instead, however, of
    taking each inaccuracy item by item, it will be simpler to give a
    consecutive account of such facts as to his ancestry, and as to
    Reginald Scott himself, as can be proved by documentary evidence or
    rendered probable by deductions therefrom.</p>

  <p>John Philipot, Rouge Dragon and Somerset Herald, who died in 1645,
    set forth the pleasant and picturesque, but slightly supported origin
    of the family. I say pleasant, because the Scotts in the times of
    Elizabeth, James, and Charles, were a family of large possessions,
    wealth, and influence, influence so great that it is said that
    Elizabeth refused the request made by Lord Buckhurst, or the Earl of
    Leicester, that Sir Thomas Scott should be ennobled, saying that he
    had already more influence in Kent than she had. She seems also to
    have had from this, or from some other reason, a personal dislike to
    them, for in her Progress in 1573, she having passed three days at
    his father-in-law’s, Sir John Baker, of Sissinghurst Castle, declined
    to visit Scotts-hall, saying she wished to proceed to her own house,
    though on her way thither she had to pass Sir Thomas’s gates. In his
    <i>Villare Cantianum</i>, p. 313, Philipot has these words: “<i>Scotts-hall</i>,
    which is now and hath been for divers Descents the Inheritance of
    eminent Gentlemen of that Sirname, whom I dare aver upon probable
    Grounds were originally called <i>Balioll</i>. <i>William Balioll</i>, second
    brother to <i>Alexander de Balioll</i>, frequently writ his Name <i>William
      de Balioll le Scot</i>, and it is probable, that upon the Tragedy of
    <i>John</i>, Earl of <i>Atholl</i>, who was made prisoner by <i>Edward</i> the first,
    and barbarously executed, in the year 1307. (whilst he endeavoured
    more nobly than successfully to defend the gasping Liberty of Scotland
    against the Eruption of that Prince;) this Family to decline the Fury
    of that Monarch, who was a man of violent passions, altered the name
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiiia">xiii</span>
    <i>Balioll</i> to that of their Extraction and Country, and assumed for
    the future the Name of <i>Scot</i>. That the Sirname of this Family was
    originally <i>Balioll</i>, I farther upon these Reasons assert. First, the
    ancient Arms of Balioll Colledge in Oxford, which was founded by <i>John
      Balioll</i>, and dedicated to St. Katharine was a Katherin-Wheele, being
    still part of the paternal Coat of this Family. Secondly, <i>David de
      Strabogie</i>, who was Son and Heir to the unfortunate Earl above-said,
    astonished with an Example of so much Terror, altered his name from
    <i>Balioll</i> to Strabogie, which was a Signory which accrued to him the
    Right of his Wife, who was Daughter and Heir to <i>John Comin</i>, Earl of
    Badzenoth and Strabogie, and by this Name King <i>Edward</i> the second,
    omitting that of <i>Balioll</i> restored <i>Chilham-castle</i> to him for Life,
    in the fifteenth year of his reign. Thirdly, the Earls of <i>Buccleugh</i>,
    and the Barons of Burley in Scotland, who derive themselves originally
    from <i>Balioll</i>, are known at this instant by no other Sirname, but
    Scot, and bear with some inconsiderable Difference, those very Arms
    which are at present the paternal Coat of the Family of <i>Scots-hall</i>.”</p>

  <p>This tradition excluded, we find that Sir William Scot of Braberne, now
    Brabourne, in Kent, is the first of whom we have historical mention.
    He was knighted in 1336, when the Black Prince was created Duke of
    Cornwall, and died in 1350: a brass to his memory, being in Weever’s
    time (1631), the first of the memorials of the Scot family in Brabourne
    church. According to Philipot, this Sir William was the same with Sir
    William Scot, then Chief Justice of England; but if Mr. Foss be right
    in stating that this latter died in 1346, the year of the Black Death,
    this view cannot be upheld.</p>

  <p>Another Sir William, apparently a grandson of the above, acquired
    through his mother the manor of Combe in Brabourne, and through his
    first wife and her relations—modes of increase in which the family seem
    to have been fortunate—that of Orlestone, as well as other places;
    and in 1420 he built Scotshall, in the manor of Hall in Smeeth, and
    was in 1428 sheriff of the county, and in 1430 knight of the shire in
    parliament. He died 1433. Scotshall, from time to time enlarged or
    rebuilt, and especially so by Sir Edward Scot, in the reign of Charles
    I, became the family seat for twelve generations. Evelyn, under date
    August 2, 1663, records his visit to it (soon after the young knight’s
    marriage), and calls it “a right noble seate,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiva">xiv</span> uniformely built, with
    a handsome gallery. It stands in a park well stor’d, the land fat and
    good. We were exceedingly feasted by the young knight, and in his
    pretty chapell heard an excellent sermon by his chaplaine.” It was
    sold, with the remaining possessions of the family, at the close of the
    last century, and destroyed in 1808. Some undulations in a field on the
    north side of the road from Ashford to Hythe, about half a mile to the
    east of Smeeth church, alone mark its site.</p>

  <p>The son of this second Sir William, named Sir John, being connected
    with the Woodvilles, and therefore with the wife of Edward IV, and
    being a staunch Yorkist, and apparently a man of intelligence, was
    employed in special embassies to Charles, Duke of Burgundy, especially
    in 1467, when he went to treat of the marriage of the king’s sister
    with the duke. He had also various other and more substantial favours
    conferred upon him from time to time, from 1461 onwards, including that
    of Chilham Castle for life, as somewhat oddly, and I think wrongly,
    noted in the extract from Philipot. He died in 1485, and probably
    intestate, as no will is recorded.</p>

  <p>To him succeeded his son, the third Sir William in this account, and
    he dying in 1524, was succeeded by his son, a second Sir John. This
    last, by his marriage with Anne, daughter of Reginald Pympe, had three
    sons, and died on the 7th October 1533. The eldest, William, followed
    his father on the 5th June 1536, and leaving no offspring, his next
    brother, Sir Reginald, took his place. Of the third brother, Richard,
    the father of our Reginald, I shall speak presently. Meanwhile,
    returning to the main line, I would say that Sir Reginald, dying on
    the 16th October 1554, was succeeded by his son, Sir Thomas, the
    “cousin” to whom Reginald was much indebted, and one of the four to
    whom he dedicated his <i>Witchcraft</i>. He was, in his day, a man of note,
    intelligence, and action. Finding his estate in debt, he yet kept one
    hundred at his table, was most hospitable, and died owing nothing,
    though, of course, to provide for the younger of his very numerous
    progeny, various portions of his estate were by his will sold after
    his death. He was deputy-lieutenant of his county, sheriff of Kent in
    1576, knight of the shire for the Parliaments of 13 and 28 Elizabeth,
    chief of the Kentish forces at Northbourne Downs, where they were
    assembled to repel any landing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xva">xv</span>
    from the Armada; and it may be added,
    as showing his promptness, readiness, and decision, that 4,000 of
    these were there, equipped for the field, the day after he received
    his orders from the Privy Council. He was one of the Commissioners to
    report on the advisability of improving the breed of horses in this
    country, and either before or after this, is said to have published a
    book on the subject. He was a Commissioner for draining and improving
    Romney Marsh, and afterwards Superintendent of the improvements of
    Dover harbour. Various letters to and from him in reference to Dover
    harbour, as well as to the Kentish forces, are to be found in the
    State Calendars. Having been the parent of seventeen children by his
    first wife, Emmeline Kempe, a relative by maternal descent, he died
    on the 30th December 1594, and Ashford parish offered to pay the
    expenses of his funeral if only they were allowed to bury him in their
    church. Most of these facts are noted in the following verses, which
    I give, chiefly because there are some probabilities that they were
    by Reginald. A copy of them seems to have been found among the family
    papers, in his handwriting. That he made some of the verse translations
    given in his <i>Witchcraft</i> is extremely probable, from the want in these
    cases of marginal references to the translator’s name; hence a second
    probability. The verses themselves render it likely that they were
    one of those memorial elegies then affixed επι ταϕον by affectionate
    friends and relatives, and not what we now call an epitaph; and the
    third verse clearly shows that they were written at least some little
    time after Sir Thomas’s decease, and therefore were not improbably
    written to be affixed to the handsome tomb erected over his remains.
    Hence a third probability; but beyond the accumulated force of these we
    cannot go.</p>

  <p>Before returning to Richard and Reginald, we may conclude this short
    notice of their ancestors by mentioning the very probable circumstance
    that the former were, by the female line, descendants of John Gower,
    the poet, as explained in the following table:</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_021.jpg" width="500" height="171" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>The Pashells, or Pashleys, were descended from Sir Edmund de Passelege,
    a Baron of the Exchequer, who purchased a manor in Smeeth in 1319; he
    died 1327. The family resided at Iden, Sussex; and the house there,
    and the manor in Smeeth, devolved on the Scots, Anne Pympe being
    her father’s only child. It is true that John Gower, the poet, does
    not mention any children in his extant will, but he was probably
    seventy-eight when he died; and, what is more to the purpose, his
    published will was probably only his testament, the will or declaration
    of uses of the land being commonly at
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviiia">xviii</span>that time a separate instrument.
    Th. Gower, of Clapham, given above as the father of Lowys, was probably
    the son or grandson of John Gower (see Sir Harris Nicolas in <i>The
      Retrosp. Rev.</i>, 2 Ser., ii, 103-17). Also Gower the poet is known to
    have had property in Southwark; and Th. Gower, of Clapham, refers in
    his will (1458) to his tenement called The Falcon, in Southwark, near
    the hospital; and in Manning and Bray’s <i>Surrey</i>, iii, 623, there is
    noticed a deed of conveyance dated 22nd November 1506, of part of the
    site of St. Thomas’s Hospital, in Southwark, made by John Scot, of
    Iden, and Anne his wife, daughter and heir of John Pashley, who was
    cousin and heir of John Gower. It may be added as curious that Sir
    Robert Gower, who is believed to have been uncle to the poet, was
    buried in Brabourne church in 1349; his monument, now destroyed, being
    noticed in Weever.</p>

  <p>On p. 500, Scot speaks of “his kinseman M. Deering”, Edw. Dering the
    divine, a writer on theological subjects and chaplain to her Majesty;
    but in what way they were kin I have been unable to discover.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">*</a></p>

  <hr class="tb" />
  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">*</span></a>
    My mother being a Dering, a daughter of the Thomas that
    was drowned in the West Indies, when trying to reach his vessel H.M.S.
    <i>Circe</i>, induces me to add, through the courtesy of Sir Edw. C. Dering,
    that a portrait of this worthy is still to be seen at Surrenden Dering,
    and that a family tradition has it, that preaching before her Majesty,
    he had the boldness to tell her, “that she had no more controul over
    her passions than an untamed heifer.” He was speedily unfrocked, and
    is said to have emigrated to America, where an Edw. Dering is at this

  <p>Returning now to Reginald’s father, Richard, the youngest of the three
    sons of that Sir John who died in 1533, we find that he married Mary,
    daughter of Geo. Whetenall, whose father was sheriff of Kent in 1527,
    and whose family had lived for three centuries at Hextall’s Place,
    near Maidstone. She survived her husband; and being remarried to Fulke
    Onslow, Clerk of the Parliaments, died before him, 8th October 1582,
    and was buried, as he afterwards was, in Hatfield church, Herts, where
    a brass to their memory is fixed in the north wall of the chancel. Of
    Richard himself nothing more is known. He probably died young, and
    certainly before December 1554, his death being mentioned in the will
    of his brother Sir Reginald, who died on the 16th of that month. In
    this will, failing his own issue—a lapse which did not occur—he left
    his real estate “unto Rainolde Scotte, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xixa">xix</span>
    son and heire of my brother
    Richard Scotte, dec<sup>d</sup>”, and Rainolde’s issue failing, it was devised
    to a more distant branch. Hence, contrary to the table given on <a href="#Page_xi">page
    <i>xi</i></a>, from “The Memorials”, “Rainolde” was either the only son of
    Richard, or the only son then living. The same conclusion follows from
    the Inquis. post mortem of Lady Wynifred Rainsfoord, taken the 20th
    March 1575/6, where Sir Thomas Scot and his brothers are said to be
    co-heirs with Reynold of the lands held by her in gavelkind, the sons
    having one moiety, and Reynold the other.</p>

  <p>This Inquisition also gives Reynold’s then age as thirty-eight or more,
    the words “et amplius” being, as was, usually at least, done in these
    documents, attached to all the other ages mentioned. Hence he was born
    in or before 1538 (not in 1541), and as, according to Wood, he entered
    Hart Hall, Oxford, when about seventeen, he entered it <i>circa</i> 1555;
    the intention that he should do so having been probably entertained
    by Sir Reginald, his uncle, who died 16th December 1554, and his
    expenses borne by his cousin, Sir Thomas. I say probably, because we
    have seen that, failing his own issue, he was named by Sir Reginald as
    the next heir to the estate, and also because we know nothing of the
    circumstances in which his widowed mother was left, nor as yet of the
    date at which she was re-married to Onslow.</p>

  <p>On the 11th of October he married Jane—not, as stated in “The
    Memorials”, Alice—Cobbe, the daughter of an old yeoman family long
    resident at Cobbe’s Place, in the adjoining parish of Aldington. The
    entry in the Registers of Brabourne is—</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">The only issue of this marriage, the only issue (that at least
    survived) of both his marriages—for the Maria in the table of “The
    Memorials” was the daughter of his second wife by her first husband—was
    Elizabeth, afterwards married to Sackville Turnor; and the only issue
    of that marriage, prior at least to Reynold’s death in 1599, was
    Cicely. Elizabeth’s birth must have been in or before 1574, for in the
    Inquis. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxa">xx</span>post mortem of Reg. Scot generosus in 1602, she is said to be
    “28 et amplius”. The Holy Maid of Kent (mentioned by Scot, p. 26) was
    servant to one of her maternal progenitors, probably to her grandfather.</p>

  <p>In this year, 1574, was also published the first issue of his brain,
    his tractate on <i>The Hoppe-Garden</i>, the first work, I believe, in which
    not only was the culture of the hop in England advocated, both as
    having been successfully tried by him, and as against its importation
    from Poppering, in Flanders, where its mode of culture, etc., was
    endeavoured to be kept secret; but the whole subject of its growth,
    culture, drying, and preservation was gone into in a practical manner,
    and further explained by woodcuts. And here it may be worth noting that
    in this year Reynold was necessarily absent so far from London that the
    publisher inserted this apologetic note: “Forasmuch as M. Scot could
    not be present at the printing of this his Booke, whereby I might have
    used his advise in the correction of the same, and especiallie of the
    Figures and Portratures conteyned therein, whereof he delivered unto me
    such notes as I being unskilfull in the matter, could not so thoroughly
    conceyve, nor so perfectly expresse as ... the Author, or you ... the
    Reader might in all poyntes be satisfied [etc., etc.].” In the second
    edition, however, in 1576, it was: “Now newly corrected and augmented,”
    the augmentations increasing the book from fifty-three pages, exclusive
    of the epilogue, to sixty, and the corrections including one added and
    one emended engraving. As a matter of curiosity, and as showing that
    neither the publisher nor the author expected a second edition, it
    may be added that though only two years had elapsed, some at least of
    the wood engravings required to be re-cut in almost exact facsimile.
    A third edition was issued in 1578, and from these we can date the
    commencement of the hop harvests in Kent.</p>

  <p>In 1575 he succeeded to one moiety of such part of Lady Winifred
    Rainsford’s estate as was held in gavelkind. Possibly, indeed, we may
    place his enjoyment of it earlier, for Lady Rainsford was declared
    insane; and to this, by the way, I am not disinclined to attribute
    Reynold’s prolonged absence from London in 1572, the attendance of some
    one of the family being required, and he, being older than the sons of
    Sir Thomas, and of a junior branch, and a man of business,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxia">xxi</span>having been
    chosen or requested to go. And I think we may place his loss of that
    estate between this date and that of 1584, the date of the publication
    of the <i>Witchcraft</i>. At least, in this <i>Discoverie</i> occur two passages
    which, taken together, seem to point to this. In his dedication to
    Sir Th. Scot he says: <a href="#p_A_vi"><i>A</i> vi</a>, “My foot being [not, having been] under
    your table, my hand in your dish, or rather in your pursse”—and, <a href="#p_A_viii"><i>A</i>
    viii</a>: “If they will allow men knowledge and give them no leave to
    use it, men were much better be without it than have it; ... it is,
    as ... to put a candle under a bushell: or as to have a ship, and to
    let hir lie alwaies in the docke: which thing how profitable it is, I
    can saie somewhat by experience.” Though it may be said that Reynold
    was a man of business, and, as appears from his writings, a man of
    decision and of unusual intelligence, still circumstances may combine
    to bring disaster as a shipowner on such a one, and more especially if
    he be new to the business. That he did in some way lose his “moiety”
    is shown by the words of his will, for, speaking of his second wife,
    he says, “whome yf I had not matched w<sup>th</sup> all I had not dyed worth
    one groate.” Not, improbably, I think, it was to the time of his first
    marriage, or to his widowership, or to both, that Wood more especially
    refers when he speaks of his giving himself up to solid reading, etc.</p>

  <p>When his first wife died and when he re-married is as yet unknown to
    us. But this latter could hardly have taken place until the latter
    end, at earliest, of 1584, since in that year he, as already quoted,
    describes himself as, “having his foot under your [Sir Th. Scot’s]
    table”, etc., or in other words, as being a dependant not worth one
    groat. Nor do we know more of this second wife beyond these slight
    particulars that we gather from Reynold’s will: that her Christian name
    was Alice—given in “The Memorials” instead of Jane, to Cobbe, the first
    wife—that she was a widow with a daughter by her former husband; and
    that she had some land, either in her own right or derived from her
    former husband. That she was a widow at the time of her remarriage is
    shown by Reynold’s bequest of “six poundes thirteene shillings foure
    pence to my daughter in Lawe Marie Collyar for apparell [? mourning]
    desiring that her mother’s hand be not anie thinge the shorter towards
    her in that respect.” Whether Collyar were this daughter’s maiden name,
    and therefore the name of her mother’s first
    <span class="pagenum" id="p_xxii">xxii</span> husband, or whether it
    were the name of her own husband, is doubtful, though from the words
    just quoted I rather incline to this second supposition, and that the
    husband was not a man of much means. With regard to what I have said
    as to the mother’s possession of property, it has been suggested to me
    by one of good judgment, and a solicitor, that Reynold’s expression
    as to not dying worth a groat was merely an excuse for leaving the
    bulk of his property to his wife; as also that these concluding words
    of the will, and the resistance of probate to it made by Elizabeth,
    his daughter by his first wife, indicate the existence of family
    differences, probably attributable to this second marriage having been
    entered into with one of a social rank inferior to his own. I cannot,
    however, deduce this latter supposition from anything we know, neither
    can I thus interpret the last words of his will, nor believe him guilty
    of such a perversion of the truth. Reading his will attentively, I
    think we find that Scot, with his usual fine sense of justice, gives
    all the lands in “Aldington, Ruckinge, and Sellinge”, which had become
    his by his marriage with Alice, “to her and <i>to her</i> [not to his]
    heires”, while he only gives his lands in Romney Marsh and his lease
    of Brabourne Rectory to her for <i>her life</i>, and then the lease at
    least, which had come to him “from his Cozen Charles”, to his daughter
    Elizabeth. Reading the last words of his will verbatim, I think it
    consistent with justice to hold, that though he may have obtained these
    lands in Romney Marsh through the use of what had been his wife’s
    former property, but was during his marriage his own, he was entitled
    to leave them to his wife only for her life, they then proceeding not,
    as did the others, to her heirs, but to his. I strongly suspect, also,
    that his casual omission of any directions as to whom these Romney
    Marsh lands were to go after her death was the real cause of the
    probate of the will being resisted by his daughter Elizabeth, so as to
    definitely raise this point.</p>

  <p>Reserving all notice of his <cite>Witchcraft</cite> till I speak of it under
    its bibliography, I would say that we know little more of his life.
    The Rev. Jos. Hunter, in his <cite>Chorus Vatum</cite>, states that he was “a
    Collector of subsidies to Q. Elizabeth in 15..., for the county of
    Kent.” Urged to inquiry by this, my friend, Jas. Gairdner, Esq., kindly
    examined for me the Exchequer documents in the Public Record Offices,
    and it appears from them that he was collector of subsidies for the
    lathe of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiiia">xxiii</span>
    Shepway in the years 28 and 29 of Elizabeth (1586–87). It may
    be added that, as appears from a previous document, <span class="frac"><sup>125</sup><span>/</span><sub>299</sub></span>, in the
    same class of papers, that Sir Reynold Scot and other Commissioners for
    the collection in the lathe of Shepway, of the first payment of the
    subsidy granted by the Parliament, 37 Henry VIII, had appointed a high
    Collector. Thus we learn the mode of his appointment; and on looking
    through the lists we find that many such were “generosi”, though the
    payment was but small. For Scot, forty shillings was deducted from the
    incomings; and this not as a percentage, but as salary.</p>

  <p>From the same documents we find that he is twice designated “armiger”,
    a word agreeing with his 1584 title-page, “by Reginald Scot, Esquire”,
    though in the editions of his <cite>Hoppe Garden</cite> his name alone is given.
    This was for myself an important find; but it will suffice here to say
    that it confirms Hunter’s supposition that this esquireship was due to
    his having been made a justice of the peace, though as to the date it
    can only as yet be said that this dignity was probably granted between
    1578 and 1584.</p>

  <p>In an <i>Accompt of Sir Th. Heanage, knight, Treasurer at Warr</i>, in the
    Public Record Offices, and printed by J. Renat Scott in the <i>Arch.

  <p class="clear">From the Muster-roll taken on the 25th Jan. 1587–8, and now in the
    possession of Mr. Oliver, it appears that the county had then furnished
    8,201 footmen and 711 horsemen, and that Sir Thomas was captain
    of the 309 trained foot raised in the lathe of Shepway, with four
    hundreds of the lathe of Scraye and Romney Marsh. Hence his office
    as Colonel-General was not given him—indeed, this is shown by the
    <i>Accompt</i>—until the men had been assembled in camp on the 29th July.
    In like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiva">xxiv</span>
    manner the Muster-roll gives Sir Jas. Hales as Captain of the
    Lances; but in the pay list Th. Scott (a son of Sir Thomas) is Captain
    both of the Light Horse and Lances. With regard to “Reinalde”, who,
    under the name of Reginald, appears in the Muster-roll as one of the
    thirteen captains over 1,499 untrained foot, Mr. J. Renat Scott, in a
    note, states that he was a son of Sir Thomas Scott; but though sons of
    Sir Thomas were also captains, this assertion is a guess, unsupported
    by any known evidence.</p>

  <p>He made his will on the 15th September 1599, and died twenty-four days
    thereafter, on the 9th October. Some say that he was either taken ill
    at Smeeth or died there, probably misinterpreting the words of his
    will; some also say that he was buried there; while some think that
    he was buried by the side of and close to Sir Thomas Scott’s tomb in
    Brabourne church; but all these, like the supposition of Philipot in
    his Kent Notes, <i>Harl. MS.</i> 3917, fol. 78<i>a</i>, that he erected that
    tomb, are mere guessings, and as such we leave them.</p>

  <p>To the few particulars thus gathered together we are obliged, with the
    exception of two small points, one probable, and the other, I think,
    certain, to confine ourselves. The first or probable point is, that as
    his name appears five times as a witness to family business documents
    between 1566 and 1594, his signature appearing in this last year in
    Sir Thomas’s will, he must have kept up familiar intercourse with the
    latter, and was not improbably, in some measure at least, his man of
    business, and possibly his steward. The second point, which also goes
    to confirm this first one, as also to confirm the belief that he was
    made a justice of the peace, as being a person whose attainments, if
    not his position, would render him useful in such a post, is one to
    which I was independently led by his writings, and which is, I find,
    borne out by almost contemporary testimony.</p>

  <p>He who in his <cite>Hoppe Garden</cite> showed such practical thought and
    foresight, and in his <cite>Witchcraft</cite> such independence of thought, was
    not a man, especially when married and a father, to live in dependence
    on a cousin. The wording, as well as the tone of his writings, agree
    with this. We find in them traces of legal study, a habit of putting
    things, as it were, in a forensic form, and noteworthy and not
    unfrequent references to legal axioms or dicta, quoted generally in
    their original Latin. The Dedication before his <cite>Hoppe Garden</cite>, and
    the first before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxva">xxv</span>
    his <cite>Witchcraft</cite>, are to men of high legal rank,
    judges, in fact, to whom he acknowledges his obligations. Referring
    the reader to these, and to the ambiguous sentence in the latter
    commencing “Finally” (sig. <a href="#p_A_ii"><i>A</i> ii</a>), I would also give the words in
    the latter, where he says, <a href="#p_A_v"><i>A.</i> v</a>: “But I protest the contrarie, and by
    these presents I renounce all protection”; and in the former the legal
    phraseology is carried on throughout in—“and be it also knowne to all
    men by these presentes that your acceptance hereof shall not be any
    wyse prejudiciall unto you, for I delyver it as an Obligation, wherein
    I acknowledge my selfe to stande further bounde unto you, without
    that, that I meane to receyve your courtesie herein, as a release of
    my further duties which I owe,” <a href="#p_A_iii_v">A. iii. v.</a> And in <a href="#p_B_v">B. v.</a>: “neither
    reproove me because by these presents I give notice thereof.” So also
    he would seem to have been an attendant at the assizes; and if we look
    to the story, told at <a href="#p_5">page 5</a>, of Marg. Simons, we find that he was not
    only present at the trial, but busied himself actively in the matter,
    talking to the vicar, the accuser, about it, advertising the poor woman
    as to a certain accusation, he “being desirous to heare what she could
    saie for hir selfe”, and inquiring into the truth of her explanation by
    the relation of divers honest men of that parish. In like manner, his
    Will is written “w<sup>th</sup> myne owne hande” twenty-five days before his
    death; and, on inquiring from a lawyer, I find that it is drawn up in
    due legal form, and by one who had had a legal training. Lastly, Thomas
    Ady, M.A., in <cite>A Candle in the Dark</cite>, 1656, alias, <cite>A Perfect Discovery
    of Witches</cite>, 1661, a book, like Scot’s, against the reality of
    witchcraft, distinctly tells us, <a href="#p_87">p. 87</a>, that Scot “was a student in the
    laws and learned in the <i>Roman</i> Laws”, the latter being exactly what
    such a man would be if he had turned towards the law as a profession.
    These considerations appear to me conclusive, even though it be added
    as an argument <i>per contra</i> that his name has not been found among
    the rolls of the Temple, Inner or Middle, or in those of Lincoln’s or
    Gray’s Inn.</p>

  <p>And in taking leave of this portion of my subject, I cannot but
    reiterate the obligations both the reader and the literary world
    generally are under to Mr. Edmund Ward Oliver. The suppositions as
    to the cause of Scot’s loss of his moiety of the estates of Lady
    Winnifred Rainsford—not, it is believed, a large sum—and as to his
    law-studentship, based as they are on facts stated by Scot or derived
    from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvia">xxvi</span>
    his writings, and those of Th. Ady, are my own; while in one
    or two instances I have put forth opinions not quite in accord with
    that gentleman’s. But nearly all the biographical facts regarding Scot
    himself and his marriages, in contradistinction to the supposed facts
    hitherto set forth, are due to the intelligent research of Mr. Oliver,
    and are not unfrequently stated in his own words.</p>

  <p>The following table will bring into one view the pedigree of Reginald
    Scot given in the previous pages:</p>

  <div class="figcenter">

  <hr class="tb" />

    <span class="label">*</span> It is noteworthy that, notwithstanding the memorial
    inscription to the first Sir William, Reginald, or whoever was the
    author of the verses to Sir Thomas, only traces the pedigree to this
    fourth knight after Sir Reginald. Either then the first Sir William was
    then accounted somewhat mythical, or not being a knight of fame, he was
    not recognised as the same with Sir William Scott, the Chief Justice of
    England.

  <p class="mt5"><i>The Cause and History of the Work.</i>—That is, what induced Scot to
    write it, and why did he set it forth as he did? inquiries which
    involve, among other matters, a short notice of the position then and
    previously held by witchcraft in England. His <cite>Hoppe-garden</cite> shows him
    to us as a man of intelligence, foresighted and reflective of thought,
    and desirous of improving the state of his country and countrymen. It
    shows him also as one who could not only seize a thought and commend
    it to others, but as one who had perseveringly put his idea into
    practice, found it feasible, and then so learnt the processes necessary
    for growing the plant, and preparing its catkins and storing them for
    use, that a priori one would suppose that he had done what he did not,
    namely, visited Holland and learnt the processes on the spot. The same
    qualities are seen in his <cite>Witchcraft</cite>, as is also his independence of
    thought. No sooner had his suspicions been aroused than he proceeded,
    as shown by the work and its references, to investigate the matter
    thoroughly and perseveringly. To this also he was encouraged, or rather
    led, by yet other two qualities, his straightforwardness or honesty of
    purpose, and his compassion, for these taught him that he was engaged
    in a righteous work, that of rescuing feeble and ignorant, though it
    may be too pretentious and shrewish, old women from false charges and a
    violent death, and in a noble work in endeavouring to stem the torrent
    of superstition and cruelty which was then beginning to overflow the
    land.</p>

  <p>Nor was this the result in any way of a mind sceptically inclined.
    His book shows that he accepted the opinions of his day, unless he
    had been led to inquire into them, and either re-receive them as
    facts or discard them. Led doubtless by his academic training, it is
    abundantly clear that he had inquired into the grounds of his belief
    in the Established Church, and into the additions that had been made
    to its faith in the course of illiterate ages by the Popish Church.
    He had read Plotina, who taught him that the so-called vicars of
    Christ and his vice-gerents on earth were often devils incarnate and
    standard-bearers of vice, and that the system which did now and again
    produce a St. Francis d’Assis—all reverence to his name—produced
    also the congeners of Loyola, and Loyola himself, whose followers,
    while assuming to themselves the holy name of Socii Jesu, made that
    name famous and infamous, and their tenets execrated throughout the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxia">xxxi</span>
    civilised world. But he accepted with some doubting, having, as he
    thought, great authority for it and no means of investigation, the
    story of the Remora; and accepted without doubting the beliefs that
    the bone of a carp’s head, and none other, staunched blood, the value
    of the unicorn’s horn, and the like, and—notwithstanding his disbelief
    in astrology—that seed-time and springing were governed by the waxing
    and waning of the moon. He also believed that precious stones owed
    their origin to the influences of the heavenly bodies; and besides his
    credulous beliefs as to certain waters, narrated at the commencement,
    he in the next chapter gives the absurdly wonderful virtues of these
    stones, some, as he says, believed in by him, “though many things most
    false are added”.</p>

  <p>How then came he to inquire into and write so strongly against
    witchcraft? Before the time of the eighth Henry, sorcerers were dealt
    with by the ecclesiastical law, which punished them as heretics.
    Moreover, their supposed offences against the person seem, chiefly
    at least, to have been taken notice of when they were supposed to
    interfere with high or state matters or persons, as in the cases of
    Joan of Arc or Dame Eleanor Cobham. But in Henry’s time, probably
    through the extension of continental ideas, aided, it may be, by a
    desire to restrain the ecclesiastical power, c. 8 of the thirty-third
    year of his reign was passed. By this it was enacted, that witches,
    etc., who destroyed their neighbours, and made pictures [images] of
    them for magical purposes, or for the same purposes made crowns,
    swords, and the like, or pulled down crosses, or declared where things
    lost or stolen were become, should suffer death and loss of lands and
    goods, as felons, and lose the privileges of clergy and sanctuary.
    Afterwards, by 1 Edw. I, c. 12, this and other offences first made
    felonies in Henry’s time were no longer to be accounted such. Thirdly,
    in the fifth year of Elizabeth, Parliament, by its twelfth chapter,
    enacted, that whereas many have practised sorceries to the destruction
    of people and their goods, those that cause death shall suffer as was
    declared by 33 Henry VIII, c. 8, except that their wives and heirs
    shall not have their rights affected by such attainder. But that when
    a person was only injured, or their goods or cattle destroyed, the
    offenders should for the first offence suffer a year’s imprisonment,
    and once a quarter be exposed in the pillory in a market town for six
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiia">xxxii</span>
    hours, and there confess their offences; and for the second offence
    suffer death as felons, with the exceptions before rehearsed. While
    any who seek treasure, or would bring about unlawful love, or hurt
    anyone in his body or goods, should for a first offence be imprisoned
    and suffer as before, and for a second be imprisoned for life and
    forfeit his goods and cattle. This, so far as humanity is concerned,
    is a distinct advance on Henry’s enactment, though an apparent going
    back from that of Edward. Perhaps, as before, it arose from a desire
    to remove the offences from the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical
    law, which would have burnt them, nor, as evidenced by its little
    results, does it seem to have been made through any mania or scare in
    the matter. This came on later, when, as we are told by Brian Darcie
    in 1582, at what time, under pie-crust promises of favour, he was
    endeavouring to get women to confess, and then be hanged,—“there is a
    man of great learning and knowledge come over lately into our Queenes
    Majestie, which hath advertised her what a companie and numbers of
    Witches be within Englande: whereupon I and other of her Justices have
    received Commission for the apprehending of as many as are within these
    limites.” Alas, this man of great learning and knowledge seems to have
    been none other than that otherwise light of the English Church, the
    great, good, and pious Bishop Jewel, who, having returned from a forced
    residence abroad, was speedily promoted by her Majesty, and in a sermon
    preached before her, in 1572, brought in the subject as follows:—</p>

  <p>“Heere perhaps some man will replie, that witches, and conjurers often
    times chase away one Divell by the meane of another. Possible it is so;
    but that is wrought, not by power, but by Collusion of the Divels. For
    one Divell, the better to attaine his purpose, will give place, and
    make as though he stood in awe of another Divell. And by the way to
    touch but a word or two of this matter for that the horrible using of
    your poore subjects inforceth thereunto. It may please your Grace to
    understand, that this kind of people, I meenes witches and sorcerers,
    within these few last yeeres, are marvellously increased within this
    your Grace’s realme. These eies have seene most evident and manifest
    marks of their wickednesse. Your Grace’s subjects pine away even unto
    the death, their collour fadeth, their flesh rotteth, their speech is
    benummed, their senses are bereft.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiiia">xxxiii</span></p>

  <p>“Wherefore, your poore subjects most humble petition unto your
    Highnesse, is, that the lawes touching such malefactours, may be put in
    due execution. For the shole of them is great, their doings horrible,
    their malice intollerable, the examples most miserable. And I pray God,
    they never practise further, then upon the subject. But this only by
    the way, these be the scholers of Beelzebub the chief captaine of the
    Divels.”</p>

  <p>The plantings of the Queen in the commissions of her Justices thus
    instigated and encouraged, produced an abundant crop. According to
    the Dedications of Scot, Sir Roger Manwood, Lord Chief Baron of the
    Exchequer, had had “in these causes such experience”, <a href="#p_A_ii_v"><i>A</i> ii. v</a>., while
    Sir Thomas Scot, as Justice of the Peace, had also had “manie poore
    old women convented before him for ... witchcraft”, <a href="#p_A_vi"><i>A.</i> vi</a>. Various
    booklets also, presently to be spoken of more at large, excited still
    more the imaginations of a credulous people, and it had been supposed,
    before Scot wrote, as will be seen on <a href="#p_473">p. 473</a>, and in my note on that
    page, that the Queen’s person had been aimed at in that way.</p>

  <p>It thus appears that though Scot may have been brought up in a
    traditional but little-regarded belief in witchcraft, he, when he was
    at least thirty-four, was not only unprepared, but startled, to witness
    and take part in this new departure from justice and mercy. Witchcraft,
    chiefly looked on as useful in discovering things lost, or in bringing
    a wished-for sweetheart to return the love of the seeker, or in curing
    ailments simple or grievous, became feared, reviled, and sought out:
    sought out by Commission of the Queen, sought out by the people as a
    great and fearful evil rapidly overspreading the land, and able and
    willing, like the Plague and Black Death, to count its victims by
    thousands, and from the cottage to the throne itself. He, a man both
    intelligent and compassionate, sees poor, old, decrepit creatures eking
    out a miserable livelihood by begging an occasional dole from their
    better off neighbours; ill-tempered by age and condition, and therefore
    abusive when refused such dole, or on slighter causes, sometimes
    perhaps through old knowledge or superstition, but probably more often
    for the sake of gain, pretending to be wise above what is known; he
    sees these accused of selling their souls for the sake of such a
    position in the world, he hears them accused sometimes of foul, more
    frequently of unlikely, crimes and acts, nay, such as an unprejudiced
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiva">xxxiv</span>
    common sense must laugh at, while the evidence is nearly always so
    faulty that, were the accusation a different one, it would be at once
    turned inside out and thrown aside. Unfortunately, too, some of these
    old women being more or less mad, and others driven through fear on the
    one hand, or through promised favour on the other, confess themselves
    capable of doing these things, though any man of sense and observation
    could detect their state or motives. Luckily, too, he had had close to
    him, and in his wife’s family, the known and talked-of imposture of the
    Holy Maid of Kent; and in his own time and close to his own door, the
    case of the Pythonist of Westwell, at first carried out triumphantly,
    and then, on her own confession and her re-acted acts, branded as an
    impostor, like the Holy Maid. The Dutchman, too, at Maidstone, after
    being set forth as a worker of miracles and an exorcist, was found to
    be a rogue; and “manie other such miracles had beene latelie printed,
    whereof diverse had beene bewraied.” He had taken part also—apparently
    as one engaged for the defence—in that piece of folly called the trial
    of Margaret Simons, and knew the history of Ade Davie, and of her
    restoration to sanity without exorcism, hanging, or burning.</p>

  <p>Is it not natural that his suspicions, and more than suspicions,
    should have been aroused, and that he should have been thus led to
    take up the whole subject seriously? One who had given himself up, as
    Wood says, to reading and thought as well as to healthy and useful
    exercise, must have sought for and obtained books on either side of
    the subject, and in especial the known book of Wier; and thoughtful
    reading of these, and meditation must have led him to extend his views,
    and gather them into a harmonious and consistent whole. Meanwhile,
    however, the bloodthirsty superstition daily increased, and there were
    published first, the mad book or books of Richard Gallis—spoken of in
    <a href="#p_132">pp. 132–3</a>—of the witches at Windsor, now, I believe, unfortunately
    lost, where, among other things, he narrates how, at a Sabbath meeting,
    he had a hand-to-hand encounter with the devil, and wounded him so
    sore that he stank of brimstone; and in 1582, there took place the
    wholesale condemnation of the poor old women of St. Osees, thirteen
    I believe of whom were hanged. There had been no such condemnation
    before in England. It is not unlikely that he himself witnessed their
    condemnation—see <a href="#Page_xxva">pp. xxv–vi</a>.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxva">xxxv</span>
    So unusual was it, that—as I cannot but believe on other evidence,
    as stated in my noting on Macbeth—a ballad was written on it, which
    became very commonly known, and was remembered as late as 1606. This
    same unusual breadth of punishment also created so much attention that
    Justice Brian Darcie thought it worth while to set forth in print, not
    the trial, but the depositions taken before him, and thus inform a too
    ignorant public that he and he alone was the primary cause of such a
    purification.</p>

  <p>These facts, and especially this last, aroused, I believe, Scot’s
    compassion and indignation, and made both find vent in printed words.
    And besides these likelihoods, including that of date, there are two
    at first sight seemingly contradictory facts, which made themselves
    manifest to me when I first carefully read the book, and before I
    had formed any opinion on their causes, and which are on this view
    reconciled. These facts are, that while the plan which he has adopted,
    and his facts and conclusions, seem to have been deliberately sought
    out, thought over, and canvassed, there are evidences throughout of
    a feverous haste of composition, such feverous haste as the above
    spoken of emotions would excite in a man like Scot, who had witnessed
    so horrible and so bloody a perversion of justice. The proof of the
    first fact I leave to be observed by the intelligent reader; but while
    the second must also be observed by him, it is needful, to the full
    exposition of my argument, that I should collect in one view most at
    least of the details. This haste is evidenced in some of his corrected
    errata, but more in those that he did not correct. Thus we have,
    on <a href="#p_174">p. 174</a>, a curious slip, by which Pharaoh becomes a Persian, and
    Nebuchadnezzar takes Pharaoh’s place as an Egyptian king, for other
    parts of the book prove conclusively that this was an unintentional
    lapsus, and one a second time overlooked when the book was re-read
    before the title-page and the preliminary leaves were set up. Similar
    are his errors as to Haias and Sedaias, for at one time he speaks of
    Rabbi Sedaias Haias, repeating it also at the last when he gives his
    “forren authors” consulted, and between these speaks of them as two
    persons, as they were. More especially would I call attention to his
    blunders as to Argerius Ferrerius. He quotes him—yet he is always
    Ferr<i>a</i>rius—five times in his text, twice in his table of contents, and
    once in his “authors used”. So in his translation from him, the “s” of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvia">xxxvi</span>
    “verbis” being indistinct in some copies, he read the word as “verbi”,
    and thereby translated the sentence into such unmistakable nonsense
    that this alone should have shown him his error. So, also, we have the
    senseless, because careless, rendering of the sword in hand passage,
    <a href="#p_257">p. 257</a>; and with these may be classed his adoption of T. R.’s curious
    mistranslations from Wier’s <cite>Pseudomonarchia</cite>, or from another copy of
    the <cite>Empto. Salomonis</cite>, for a moment’s consideration would have shown
    him their absurdity, and led him to turn to Wier. In <a href="#p_19">p. 19</a> also, we
    find “infants” where, as stated in my note, all the editions of the
    <cite>Mal. Malef.</cite> in the British Museum have “infames”; and this, though a
    slip of memory, betokens, when taken with the rest, overhaste. These
    slips, in an ordinary writer, would lead to another conclusion, but not
    in this case, where we have evidence of both ordinary and recondite
    knowledge, of conclusions tried by actual experiment, of a quick and
    intelligent perception, and of what may be called, in a good sense,
    a ready and acute subtlety in refuting or retorting allegations or
    objections.</p>

  <p>Our author’s indebtedness to Cornelius Agrippa and to Wier has, in a
    great measure, been anticipated in what has been said; but a few words
    may here be added. Casually coming across their books when he became a
    reader of out-of-the-way works, he did not become a follower of theirs,
    and then write a book, as the disciples of Pythagoras wrote books to
    expound and hand down the doctrines of their master. Wier had written
    a book against witchcraft, and a clear and comprehensive book. But
    while Scot certainly followed Wier in point of time, and as certainly
    was much indebted to him for the perfecting of his book, yet, as I
    have said, Scot seems to have taken up his belief against the reality
    of witchcraft from what he in his own experience had witnessed; and
    my view, that he was then led to read Wier and Cornelius Agrippa, and
    the writers on the other side, seems to me confirmed by what we find
    as to his indebtedness to Wier. The “Notings on Wier” show that, while
    he copied him in some other instances, he borrowed from him mainly
    a long list of illustrations, some of which even he may have drawn
    independently from the same sources as did Wier.</p>

  <p><i>Bibliography.</i>—We do not find an entry of Scot’s <cite>Hoppe-garden</cite> in the
    Stationers’ Registers, because the entries about 1574 are wanting.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxviia">xxxvii</span>But
    why do we not find so large and important a book as the <cite>Witchcraft</cite>
    of 1584 so entered, the writer being of a family of no mean repute,
    and the head of his house, Sir Th. Scot, being in those days a man
    of some mark? The answer, after what has been said, is simple. He
    upheld and defended a heresy, the existence and diabolical powers and
    practices of witches being believed in and guarded against, by the
    Queen, the bishops, and the people. Hence the reply of the Stationers’
    Company would most certainly have been—the same as in more trifling
    cases—“provided he shall get the bishop of London his alowance to
    yt”, words which, under the circumstances, would have been a refusal,
    and a refusal which, had any steps been taken against him after its
    publication, would have told against him. Hence he resolved to print
    it, taking all the blame and responsibility on his own shoulders, no
    stationer’s name being connected with it, and the name of the printer
    appearing only at the end of the book, without date or place of
    address—“Imprinted at London by | <i>William Brome</i>.” And here, by the
    way, it may be mentioned that though called in catalogues a quarto, its
    signatures are in eights. As before stated, both Thomas Ady and Anthony
    à Wood tell us that it “did for a time make great impressions on the
    Magistracy and Clergy”, and that it did so generally is shown by the
    appearance of Webster’s, Ady’s, and other books on the same side, and
    those of Gifford, Perkins, and others, on the other, including King
    James, who, in 1597, issued his <cite>Dæmonologie</cite> specially against it.
    Whether Elizabeth or the authorities under her took any notice of it is
    doubtful, for, as I have said, he was still an Esquire in 1587; and the
    last words of his will, “for greate is the trouble my poor wief hath
    had with me, and small is the comforte she hath receyved at my hands”,
    and his designation of himself as “gent.”, point rather to a voluntary
    surrender of his office, through weakness and ill-health, than to a
    dismissal.</p>

  <p>But zeal for the truth, as he believed it, combined with his fears for
    himself, for he believed that he had been the object of witchcraft and
    of the machinations of the evil powers more than once, though luckily
    in vain, led the royal author on the other side to cause Scot’s book to
    be burned by the common hangman; and, as is also said by Cole, not one
    copy alone, as significant of its character, and of its
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxviiia">xxxviii</span> being a <i>liber
    prohibitus</i> in the eyes of this Protestant Pope, but as many as could
    be laid hands upon. While, too, I have as yet found no direct proof
    of this latter statement, it is perhaps in some degree confirmatory
    of it, that no copies of the book exist in the library of St. Paul’s
    Cathedral, nor in that of Lambeth Palace, nor in that of Sion College.
    To the same cause is most likely due the exceedingly neat copy of
    various chapters, and parts of chapters, contained in the Sloane MS.,
    ff. 2189, in the British Museum, its date according to the experts
    there being <i>circa</i> 1620. At one time I had suspected that these
    extracts had been made with the intent of writing a book either for or
    against the truth of witchcraft; but the methodical neatness of all but
    the first two or three pages, the manner in which the typographical
    form of the book is followed, the consecutive, though broken manner, in
    which the extracts follow one another, the absence of any word or any
    sign of remark or comment throughout, now cause me to hold that it was
    a copy made by or for one who took such portions as he wished from a
    book otherwise inaccessible.</p>

  <p>Turning back to this burning, I would say also that I have not come
    across any English contemporary, or even early statement as to it, much
    less as to its date. Perhaps, however, without much fear of error, we
    may suppose it to have been done immediately after the Act against
    witches, passed in the first year of James’s reign. By it the Act 5
    Eliz. was repealed, and any conjuration, etc., of an evil spirit was
    made a crime punishable by death as a felon, the culprit losing all
    benefit of clergy and sanctuary. The finding of treasure by magical
    means, provoking to unlawful love, or destroying of cattle, was for
    the first offence to bring with it imprisonment for one year, standing
    in the pillory once a quarter for six hours, and confessing his crime,
    as in the Act repealed; and for the second offence death as a felon,
    though the dowry and the heirship were not attainted. This Act itself
    shows how strong were James’s convictions in the matter, as does the
    publication in London of his <cite>Dæmonologie</cite> in the same year, it being
    entered on the Stationers’ Registers on the 3rd April 1603. Scot’s book
    was therefore against James’s belief, and the esteem in which it was
    held against his own powers as a reasoner and author. While, however,
    so far as I can find, we owe the knowledge of this burning to a German
    source, its extreme likelihood is corroborated by
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxix">xxxix</span> what I have said,
    that James’s belief in witchcraft was with him an undoubted Article of
    Faith, and by the fact that various books, known and unknown, were at
    different times publicly burnt during his reign, though no official
    records of these burnings have been preserved.</p>

  <p>Cole, as quoted in Bliss’s edition of the <cite>Athen. Oxon.</cite>, gives the
    account as made by Thomasius de crimine magiæ, a book which I believe
    does not exist. There is a Thesis inaugaralis de crimine magiæ
    submitted in 1701 by Johan Reiche to the Regia Academia Fredericiana
    ... præside D. Christiano Thomasio. But Reiche refers to an earlier
    writer—“Gisberti Voetii | Theologiæ in Acad. Ultrajectina Professoris

  <p>Dr. W. N. du Rieu, Librarian of the University of Leyden, kindly
    informs me, that a translation into Dutch, “omitting some formulæ
    of malediction and other matters which would more interest English
    readers,” was made and edited by Th. Basson, an English stationer
    living at Leyden in 12mo in 1609. It was undertaken at the instigation
    of the professors of law and history, and its dedication, dated 10th
    January 1609, was to the Curators of the University, and to the
    burgomasters of Leyden. A second and corrected edition, published by
    his son, G. Basson, was also printed at Leyden in 1637, though the
    dedication is dated 8th May 1637, Amsterdam.</p>

  <p>Though in various of the notes the passages have been spoken of, yet to
    call attention to the matter, and in the hope that others may be more
    successful, I would add that I have not discovered the principle on
    which he went, nor his authorities, for his Scripture readings. In his
    Latin quotations he generally quotes the Vulgate, twice or thrice Beza,
    or Beza varied, while at other times he goes by some other translation,
    or possibly makes it himself. So his long English quotation, <a href="#p_284">p. 284</a>,
    is not taken from Wycliffe’s, Tyndale’s, Cranmer’s, Coverdale’s,
    Matthews’, or from the Genevan, Bishops’, or Rheims versions, though
    more like the Genevan, while, curiously enough, it precedes the one of
    1611 by one or two verbal coincidences. Hence, I believe that he varied
    the Genevan version according to his own views and taste, and am the
    more inclined to this in that the passage is not in Italics, the then
    type and mark of quotations, but in Romans.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding, however, the decree that had gone forth, and,
    notwithstanding the strange Sadducean assertion, not argument, set
    forth by James, and followed by John Rainolds, D.D., in his work on the
    Apocrypha (<i>tom.</i> ii, 1032), and by Gisbert Voet, the book’s inherent
    excellency, as reported by Ady, and as evidenced by the notices of
    it in the various books on either side that afterwards came forth,
    and in part, perhaps, through that decree itself, called for its
    reproduction; and in 1651 it was issued with a new title-page, though
    naturally it was again not entered on the Stationers’ Registers. This
    time it was really—as evidenced by the signatures—a quarto. The text
    was one and the same with that printed off by Richard Cotes; but
    there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xli">xli</span>
    three issues, and three slightly different title-pages.
    The first bears—LONDON | Printed by <i>Richard Cotes</i>. 1651. The second
    has—<i>Printed by</i> R. C. <i>and are to be sold by</i> Giles Calvert, <i>dwelling
    at the | Black Spread-Eagle at the West-end of</i> Pauls. 1651. And except
    for these final words, separated on both title-pages by a line from the
    rest, both are word for word, and even to the misprint “superstions”
    identical. The explanation, in all probability, if not certainty, being
    that my “first” one was the first issue, when the publisher thought
    it more prudent to withhold his name; the other, a second issue of
    copies still called for, when, finding no ill results, he had become
    bolder. The third has below the line spoken of: <i>London</i> | Printed
    by E. [not R.] Cotes and are to be sold by Thomas Williams at the |
    Bible in <i>Little Britain</i> 1654. In this “<span class="smcap">Scots</span>” is printed without the
    apostrophe, “men”, “women”, and “children”, as also “treatise”, have
    capital initials; on both occasions it has “Devils”, not “Divels”;
    and the last line but one above the dividing line ends “De-” not
    “Divels”, and “superstions” is rightly printed “superstitions”. These
    variations in the title-page, and the exact conformity of the text as
    to the various peculiarities of the letters, words, and sizes of the
    punctuation, show that Williams had come into possession of Calvert’s
    remainder, or of his set-up type, and had issued these sheets,
    prefixing a new title-page of his own, printed by E. Cotes.</p>

  <p>There is not the slightest evidence of a copy of the 1584 edition
    having been prepared for the press, beyond the new title-page, and on
    two occasions the translation of Latin, that Scot had not—as he had
    done in similar instances—translated. The Latin-named ingredients on
    <a href="#p_184">p. 184</a> are Englished, and I have thus been enabled to give them in my
    notings with the more probability that they are correct. The second
    instance is, as stated in my margin, on <a href="#p_416">p. 416</a>. Two or three press
    errors are corrected, one of them not a certain emendation, and all
    within the competency of an ordinary compositor or reader; but no
    others, not even that of “increase” for “incense”, <a href="#p_446">p. 446</a>, while fresh
    errors, indicative of a careless “reader”, are made.</p>

  <p>What has been thus said as to the character of this second reprint,
    goes to prove that it was a publisher’s venture based upon the demand
    for the book, and, therefore, for gain, and one which he carried out
    spite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlii">xlii</span>
    of its having been burnt, and placed among the “prohibited
    books”. In like manner, and for the like purpose, and as before,
    without entry in the Stationers’ Registers, there was brought out
    the third, and so-called folio edition of 1665, though the sheets
    are in sixes. All but the title-page, which, curiously enough, was
    again re-written, though still bearing, like the second, the words,
    “By Reginald Scot Esquire”; it is a careless reprint of that second,
    with all its errors, and new ones superadded. But as a novelty and
    inducement to buy, nine chapters, commencing the fifteenth book, and a
    second book of the “Discourse on Devils and Spirits”, were added by an
    anonymous author. Who this anonymity was, I have uselessly spent some
    little time in inquiring, time that might have been better employed,
    even had I found him. But it goes to prove that these additions were
    merely made for novelty’s sake, and its glamour and gain, in that
    the writer was a believer in, and not improbably, from his minute
    directions, as well as from his reticence, a practiser of witchcraft,
    or of what he thought to be witchcraft. He also, and I give this as one
    possible clue, was a strong believer in the perishable Astral spirit
    of a man, as well as of Astral spirits in general, and much of his
    “Discourse” is taken up with remarks on these.</p>

  <p>I may here add, as showing the carelessness with which these second and
    third editions were edited, a note of the errata marked in the first
    and not corrected in them.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_75">75</a>, 21. “We,” so the second; in the third the (,) is rightly placed
    after “years”. A correction that could have been made by the least
    intelligent of “readers”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_168">168</a>, 31. “Earth <i>read</i> firmament.” Not corrected.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_247">247</a>, 29. “Write <i>add</i> it.” Not corrected.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_269">269</a>, 16. “If there be masses <i>delete</i> If.” Retained, but the second
    attempts to correct by inserting “no” before “masses”, and the third
    follows suit, though it is as nonsensical as before.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_463">463</a>, 16. “Their business <i>read</i> that business.” Not corrected.</p>

  <p>Beyond these, the limited edition now printed is the only other known
    to me. As stated in the preface, it is a reprint of the first edition,
    with some slight alterations in the lettering, but not in the spelling.
    Besides the few errata that have been found and recorded, the small
    heading on its left hand pages up to <a href="#p_24">p. 24</a> is <span class="small">“Chap. —”</span>,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliii">xliii</span> like that on
    the right hand, instead of being “<span class="small">1 or 2 Booke</span>”. So also in
    the earlier pages, the marginal references, though correct, are not
    printed line for line with the original. The pictorial initial letters
    of the first chapter of each book occupy in the original almost a
    third of the page. The first word of a chapter has only its first two
    letters—including its pictorial letter—in capitals, but the remainder,
    as well as the rest of the first line, is in larger type than the
    rest. The original being also in black letter was enabled to use both
    Romans and Italics as variants, whereas the reprint could only use
    Italics. The rule of the original is, however, in general very simple.
    “The — Chapter”, the contents of the chapter and proper names are in
    Romans; “The — Booke” and quotations in Italics; the translations of
    quotations in Romans. Wherever there can be any doubt the type of the
    original is marked in the margin, as are occasional uses by the author
    of [] to distinguish them from the editor’s use of the same. It may be
    added that “The — Chapter”, and the contents of the chapter, have been
    transposed. The V like arrangement of the lines at the end of a chapter
    have not been followed, but been imitated according to the spirit in
    which they were employed; for, after an investigation made for the
    purpose, it was found that they do not indicate a division of the text
    or matter, but were simply compositors’ devices to fill up a page when
    that page either ended a book, or when its blank space did not allow
    of the commencement of a new chapter. Similarly, on one page, a (∵)
    was added to complete the page. And, in like manner, if there was still
    space at the end of a book, an engraving was inserted. I would add
    that all the page references that I make are to the pages of the 1584
    edition.</p>

  <p>I had collected for an appendix various grammatical peculiarities of
    the age; but they increased the number of pages, and therefore the
    price of the book, without, as seemed to me, sufficient cause, more
    especially as the reader can readily consult Dr. Abbot’s <i>Shakesperian
      Grammar</i>, as well as notices in other books. One point, however, ought
    to be attended to. Though an educated and University man, accustomed to
    Latin and Greek, he, like all of his time, followed the then frequent
    habit of using singular verbs after plural nominatives not immediately
    preceding them. A close examination of these, both in Scot and Greene,
    another literate and Utriusque Academiæ in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliv">xliv</span> Artibus Magister; and one
    notable one in Ben Jonson, who elsewhere, so far as I know, avoids this
    error; as well as those in Shakespeare and others, have shown me that
    they cannot be explained as is sought in Dr. Abbot’s <i>Shakesperian
    Grammar</i>, § 333, where the form of the verb is held to be a remnant of
    the northern early English third person plural in “s”. The instances
    alone of the auxiliary verbs so used set this theory aside, and show
    that the custom was due to carelessness, habit, the remoteness or after
    position of the true nominatives, and to the nearness of another word,
    sometimes even to a transposed objective; or of a “that” or “which”
    that had the look of a singular, or in the case of a double nominative,
    to both words being considered as implying one thought, as indeed they
    often did, being merely synonyms. Our Elizabethan ancestors would
    have said: “Pity and compassion moves me,” because they held pity
    and compassion were one and the same; and the habit of using Saxon
    and Latin, or other synonyms, led them to use the same construction
    when the meanings were but allied. This seems to me the more likely
    explanation: but the reader may prefer this—that our ancestors took the
    phrase to be elliptical, and that the verb really employed after both
    substantives was to be understood after the first and before the “and”.</p>

  <p><i>Contemporary Notices of Scot.</i>—Of strictly contemporary notices, I
    know of but two. In Nash’s <i>Four Letters Confuted</i>, 1593, he asks, ed.
    Grosart, ii, 252: “How is the <i>Supplication</i> a diabolicall Discourse,
    otherwise than as it intreats of the diverse natures and properties
    of Divels and spirits? in that far fetcht sense may the famous
    <i>defensative against supposed Prophecies</i>, and <i>the Discoverie of
    Witchcraft</i> be called notorious Diabolicall discourses, as well as the
    <i>Supplication</i>, for they also intreate of the illusions and sundrie
    operations of spirits.” The second is in Gabriel Harvey’s <i>Pierce’s
    Supererogation</i>, 1593, ed. Grosart, ii, 291: “Scottes discoovery of
    Witchcraft, dismasketh sundry egregious impostures, and in certaine
    principall Chapters, &amp; speciall passages, hitteth the nayle on the head
    with a witnesse: howsoever I could have wished, [G. H. is nothing if
    he be not quasi-critical and emending] he had either dealt somewhat
    more curteously with Monsieur Bodine, or cōfuted him somewhat more
    effectually.”</p>

  <p>Of course, various of the after-writers on witchcraft, whichever
    side they took, either spoke of him explicitly, or alluded to him;
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlv">xlv</span>
    Webster, Wagstaffe, Ady, and others, on the same side as Scot, and
    Meric Casaubon, Cotta, etc., ending with Glanvil on the other. But
    these, the really curious in such matters may be left to search out
    for themselves. Only I would like to mention John Deacon’s and John
    Walker’s <i>Dialogicall Discourses of ... Devils</i> [etc.], 1601, both
    because they, being clergymen, had the boldness—besides adding new
    arguments of their own, and though their wording is somewhat less
    decided than their own evident belief—out of three explanations of the
    case of the Witch of Endor which they set before the reader, to plainly
    prefer Scot’s view of her ventriloquism, both naming him in the text,
    and giving the reference to his page in their margin; and secondly,
    because so far as a hasty look enables one to give an opinion, they
    spoke more rationally on magical and other points than one would at
    that date expect. They also quote the opinion of Hippocrates on magical
    cures, as given by Scot, p. 450, and show that they take it, though
    not literally, from him, and not from Hippocrates directly, by giving
    a reference to Scot in the margin. Afterwards they published in 1603,
    a second large work, <i>A summarie</i>[?] <i>answer to John Darrell</i>, the first
    work having been also suggested by the same impostor, and his setting
    forth of himself as a caster out of devils.</p>

  <p>I have said on <a href="#p_xxii">p. <i>xxii</i></a> that the discovery of Scot’s name in the
    Subsidy Rolls for 1586 and 1587 with the affix of “Armiger” was for me
    an important find. And now I would explain that it was so, inasmuch
    as it set my mind at rest as to the oneness of the Raynold of the
    <i>Hoppe-garden</i> with the Reginald Scot Esquire, of the <i>Witchcraft</i>.
    Aware that Reynold and Reginald were variants of one name, used of
    and by the same person, the following facts hindered me for a long
    time from accepting the common belief that the Raynold and Reginald
    of these two works were one and the same. First, the author of the
    <i>Hoppe-garden</i> in each of his signatures to the editions of 1574–6–8,
    three in each, appears as Raynold. In the marriage entry, in the
    pay-account of the Kent forces, in the Muster-roll, and in the Will,
    it is also Raynold. But in 1584, throughout the <i>Witchcraft</i>, that is,
    four times in all, the name appears as Reginald. Secondly, in the Will
    of 1599, in accordance with the want of any title on the title-page
    of the <i>Hoppe-garden</i>, he describes himself as “gent”, and in the
    Inquisitio p. m., though he is called Reginald, the document being in
    Latin, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlvi">xlvi</span>
    is, as in his Will, “generosus”. But in the title-page of
    the <i>Witchcraft</i>, he is Reginald Scot Esquire. The finding no evidence
    of the separate existence of a Raynold and a Reginald, the frequent
    references to the Scriptures in the <i>Witchcraft</i>, and the very frequent
    references to the Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, in the “Address to the
    Reader” of the <i>Hoppe-garden</i>, the use in both works, as already
    quoted, of certain legal phrases, and the occurrence in the prefatory
    part of the <i>Hoppe-garden</i> of “with the licour (or rather the lucre)”,
    and “condemne the man, or rather the mynde”, a trick of language not
    unfrequently repeated in the <i>Discoverie</i>, a trick resulting from his
    love of irony, shook my doubts. But there were still, the want of any
    title after the name in the <i>Hoppe-garden</i>, the “gent” of the Will,
    and the “generosus” of the Inquisitio, as against the “Esquire” of the
    <i>Discoverie</i>. First, however, Hunter’s suggestion, that his esquireship
    was due to his having been appointed a Justice of the Peace, and then
    the discovery of armiger after his name, have removed all reasonable
    doubts; and to turn our belief to a positive certainty, it only remains
    to discover that he was a Justice of the Peace.</p>

  <p>Possibly the reader may now expect some pages on Scot’s style as a
    writer, and on his claim—his claim, yet not one made by himself—to be
    considered an English classic. But, besides that, I am not “greatly
    æsthetic”, and besides having expressed my opinions in more than
    one place in this Introduction, I think that any reader, with any
    appreciation of style, and of the manner in which an argument ought to
    be carried out, can come to but one conclusion. Such belief, I may add,
    is strengthened by this, that most writers whom I have consulted are
    of this opinion: and I would conclude with three quotations, chiefly
    regarding the way in which he carried out his argument. The Rev. Jos.
    Hunter, in his MS. <i>Chorus Vatum</i>, ch. v, says: “In fact, I had no
    notion of the admirable character of this book till I read it this
    September 1839. It is one of the few instances in which a bold spirit
    opposes himself to the popular belief, and seeks to throw protection
    over a class of the defenceless. In my opinion, he ought to stand very
    prominent in any catalogue of Persons who have been public benefactors.”</p>

  <p>“To answer his argument was wholly impossible, and though the
    publication of his book did not put an end to the notion which
    continued <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlvii">xlvii</span>
    very prevalent for a century afterwards [though we know from
    Ady that it greatly checked the belief for a time], yet it had, I have
    no doubt, much to do with the silent and gradual extinction of it.”</p>

  <p>So D’Israeli, in his <i>Amenities of Literature</i>, has these words: “A
    single volume sent forth from the privacy of a retired student, by its
    silent influence may mark an epoch in the history of the human mind.”</p>

  <p>“Such a volume was <i>The Discoverie of Witchcraft</i>, by Reginald Scot,
    a singular work, which may justly claim the honour in this country of
    opening that glorious career which is dear to humanity and fatal to
    imposture.”</p>

  <p class="mb5">Thirdly, Professor W. T. Gairdner, M.D. and LL.D., thus speaks, in his
    address on “Insanity: Modern Views as to its Nature and Treatment”,
    read before the Glasgow Medico-Chirurgical Society: “But I cannot
    leave it [witchcraft] ... without expressing, more strongly than even
    Mr. Lecky does, the unqualified admiration and surprise which arise
    in the mind on finding that in 1584 ... there was at least one man in
    England ... who could scan the whole field of demonology, and all its
    terrible results in history, with an eye as clear from superstition,
    and a judgment as sound and unwavering in its opposition to abuses, as
    that of Mr. Lecky himself. There is only one book, so far as I know, in
    any language, written in the sixteenth or even the seventeenth century,
    that merits this praise: and it is a book which, notwithstanding its
    wide human interest, its great and solid learning, and a charming
    English style that makes it most readable, even at the present day,
    has never been reprinted for two hundred years, and is therefore
    extremely inaccessible to most readers. Reginald Scot’s <cite>Discoverie of
    Witchcraft</cite> ... stands brightly out amid the darkness of its own and
    the succeeding age, as a perfectly unique example of sagacity amounting
    to genius.” He adds: “Nothing, however, is more evident than that Scot,
    however indebted to Wier (and both of them, probably, to Cornelius
    Agrippa ...), was far in advance of either in the clearness of his
    views and the unwavering steadiness of his leanings to the side of
    humanity and justice.”</p>

    NSOMUCH as I know that your Lordship is by nature whollie inclined,
    and in purpose earnestly bent to releeve the poore, and that not
    onlie with hospitalitie and almes, but by diverse other devises and
    waies tending to their comfort, having (as it were) framed and set
    your selfe to the helpe and maintenance of their estate; as appeareth
    by your charge and travell in that behalfe. Whereas also you have a
    speciall care for the supporting of their right, and redressing of
    their wrongs, as neither despising their calamitie, nor yet forgetting
    their complaint, seeking all meanes for their amendement, and for the
    reformation of their disorders, even as a verie father to the poore.
    Finallie, for that I am a poore member of that commonwelth, where
    your Lordship is a principall person; I thought this my travell, in
    the behalfe of the poore, the aged, and the simple, might be/
    <span class="snp" id="p_A_ii_v"><i>A.</i> ii. <i>v.</i></span> verie
    fitlie commended unto you: for a weake house requireth a strong staie.
    In which respect I give God thanks, that hath raised up unto me so
    mightie a freend for/<span class="snp">A. v.</span>
    them as your Lordship is, who in our lawes have
    such knowledge, in government such discretion, in these causes such
    experience, and in the commonwealth such authoritie; and neverthelesse
    vouchsafe to descend to the consideration of these base and inferior
    matters, which minister more care and trouble, than worldlie estimation.</p>

  <p>And in somuch as your Lordship knoweth, or rather exerciseth the office
    of a judge, whose part it is to heare with courtesie, and to determine
    with equitie; it cannot but be apparent unto you, that when punishment
    exceedeth the fault, it is rather to be thought vengeance than
    correction. In which respect I knowe you spend more time and travell in
    the conversion and reformation, than in the subversion &amp; confusion of
    offenders, as being well pleased to augment your owne private paines,
    to the end you may diminish their publike smart. For in truth, that
    commonwealth remaineth in wofull state, where fetters and halters beare
    more swaie than mercie and due compassion.</p>

  <p>Howbeit, it is naturall to unnaturall people, and peculiar unto
    witchmongers, to pursue the poore, to accuse the simple, and to kill
    the innocent; supplieng in rigor and malice towards others, that
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span> which
    they themselves want in proofe and discretion, or the other in offense
    or occasion. But as a cruell hart and an honest mind doo seldome meete
    and feed togither in a dish; so a discreet and mercifull magistrate,
    and a happie commonwealth cannot be separated asunder. How much then
    are we bound to God, who hath given us a Queene, that of justice is not
    only the very perfect image &amp; paterne; but also of mercie &amp; clemencie
    (under God) the meere fountaine &amp;/
    <span class="snp">A. 2.</span>
    bodie it selfe? In somuch as they
    which hunt most after bloud in/<span class="snp" id="p_A_iii"><i>A.</i> iii.</span> these daies, have least authoritie to
    shed it. Moreover, sith I see that in cases where lenitie might be
    noisome, &amp; punishment wholesome to the commonwealth; there no respect
    of person can move you, no authoritie can abash you, no feare, no
    threts can daunt you in performing the dutie of justice.</p>

  <p>In that respect againe I find your Lordship a fit person, to judge and
    looke upon this present treatise. Wherein I will bring before you, as
    it were to the barre, two sorts of most arrogant and wicked people, the
    first challenging to themselves, the second attributing unto others,
    that power which onelie apperteineth to God,<sup>a</sup>
    <span class="sni"><sup>a</sup> Apoc. 4, 11.</span>
    who onelie is the Creator of all things,<sup>b</sup>
    <span class="sni"><sup>b</sup> Rom. 8.<br />Acts. 5.<br />Apoc. 2.</span>
    who onelie searcheth the heart and reines, who onelie<sup>c</sup>
    <span class="sni"><sup>c</sup> Luke. 16.</span>
    knoweth our imaginations and thoughts, who onelie<sup>d</sup>
    <span class="sni"><sup>d</sup> Dan. 2. &amp; 28, &amp; 47.</span>
    openeth all secrets, who<sup>e</sup>
    <span class="sni"><sup>e</sup> Psalm. 72. &amp; 136.<br />Jer. 5.</span>
    onelie worketh great wonders, who onelie hath power<sup>f</sup>
    <span class="sni"><sup>f</sup> Job, 5. &amp; 36.<br />Sam. 12.<br />1. Reg. 8.<br />2. Reg. 3.<br />Isaie. 5.<br />Zach. 10. &amp; 14.<br />Amos. 4. 7.</span>
    to raise up &amp; cast downe; who onelie maketh thunder, lightning, raine,
    tempests, and restraineth them at his pleasure; who onelie<sup>g</sup>
    <span class="sni"><sup>g</sup> Job. 1.</span>
    sendeth life and death, sicknesse &amp; health, wealth and wo;
    who neither giveth nor lendeth his<sup>h</sup>
    <span class="sni"><sup>h</sup> Isaie. 42, 8.</span> glorie to anie creature.</p>

  <p>And therefore, that which greeveth me to the bottome of my hart,
    is, that these witchmongers cannot be content, to wrest out of Gods
    hand his almightie power, and keepe it themselves, or leave it with
    a witch: but that, when by drift of argument they are made to laie
    downe the bucklers, they yeeld them up to the divell, or at the least
    praie aid of him, as though the raines of all mens lives and actions
    were committed into his hand; and that he sat at the sterne, to guide
    and direct the course of the whole world, imputing unto him power and
    abilitie inough to doo as great things, and as strange miracles as ever
    Christ did.</p>

  <p>But the doctors of this supernaturall doctrine saie/
    <span class="snp">A. 2. v.</span>somtimes, that
    the witch doth all these things by vertue of hir/
    <span class="snp" id="p_A_iii_v"><i>A.</i> iii. <i>v.</i></span> charmes; sometimes
    that a spirituall, sometimes that a corporall divell doth accomplish
    it; sometimes they saie that the divell doth but make the witch
    beleeve she doth that which he himselfe hath wrought; sometimes that
    the divell seemeth to doo that by compulsion, which he doth most
    willinglie. Finallie, the writers hereupon are so eloquent, and full
    of varietie; that sometimes they write that the divell dooth all this
    by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
    Gods permission onelie; sometimes by his licence, somtimes by his
    appointment: so as (in effect and truth) not the divell, but the high
    and mightie king of kings, and Lord of hosts, even God himselfe, should
    this waie be made obedient and servile to obeie and performe the will
    &amp; commandement of a malicious old witch, and miraculouslie to answere
    hir appetite, as well in everie trifling vanitie, as in most horrible
    executions; as the revenger of a doting old womans imagined wrongs, to
    the destruction of manie innocent children, and as a supporter of hir
    passions, to the undoing of manie a poore soule. And I see not, but a
    witch may as well inchant, when she will; as a lier may lie when he
    list: and so should we possesse nothing, but by a witches licence and
    permission.</p>

  <p>And now forsooth it is brought to this point, that all divels, which
    were woont to be spirituall, may at their pleasure become corporall,
    and so shew themselves familiarlie to witches and conjurors, and to
    none other, and by them onlie may be made tame, and kept in a box,
    &amp;c. So as a malicious old woman may command hir divell to plague hir
    neighbor: and he is afflicted in manner and forme as she desireth. But
    then commeth another witch, and she biddeth hir divell helpe, and he
    healeth the same partie. So as they/<span class="snp">A 3</span> make it a kingdome divided in it
    selfe, and therefore I trust it will not long endure, but will shortlie
    be overthrowne, according to the words of our Savior, <i>Omne regnum in
    se divisum desolabitur</i>, Everie king/dome<span class="snp" id="p_A_iiii"><i>A.</i> iiii.</span>
    divided in it selfe shalbe desolate.</p>

  <p>And although some saie that the divell is the witches instrument, to
    bring hir purposes and practises to passe: yet others saie that she is
    his instrument, to execute his pleasure in anie thing, and therefore
    to be executed. But then (me thinks) she should be injuriouslie dealt
    withall, and put to death for anothers offense: for actions are not
    judged by instrumentall causes; neither dooth the end and purpose
    of that which is done, depend upon the meane instrument. Finallie,
    if the witch doo it not, why should the witch die for it? But they
    saie that witches are persuaded, and thinke, that they doo indeed
    those mischeefs; and have a will to performe that which the divell
    committeth: and that therefore they are worthie to die. By which reason
    everie one should be executed, that wisheth evill to his neighbor,
    &amp;c. But if the will should be punished by man, according to the
    offense against God, we should be driven by thousands at once to the
    slaughterhouse or butcherie.<span class="sni">Proverb. 5.</span>
    For whosoever loatheth correction shall
    die. And who should escape execution, if this lothsomnesse (I saie)
    should extend to death by the civill lawes. Also the reward of sinne is
    death. Howbeit, everie one that sinneth, is not to be put to death by
    the magistrate. But (my Lord) it shalbe proved in my
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span> booke, and your
    Lordship shall trie it to be true, as well here at home in your native
    countrie, as also abrode in your severall circuits, that (besides
    them that be <i>Venificæ</i>, which are plaine poisoners) there will be
    found among our witches onelie two sorts; the one sort being such by
    imputation, as/<span class="snp">A 3 v</span> so thought of by others (and these are abused, and not
    abusors) the other by acceptation, as being willing so to be accompted
    (and these be meere cousenors.)</p>

  <p>Calvine<span class="sni"><i>Instit. lib. 5. ca. 8. sect. 6.<br />Item upon Deut. cap. 18.<br />Lib. de lamiis, pag. 5.</i></span>
    treating of these magicians, calleth them cousenors, saieng
    that they use their juggling knacks onelie to amase or abuse the
    people; or else for fame: but he/<span class="snp"><i>A.</i> iiij. <i>v.</i></span> might rather have said for gaine.
    Erastus himselfe, being a principall writer in the behalfe of witches
    omnipotencie, is forced to confesse, that these Greeke words, <i>μαγία,
    μαγγαγία, φαρμακία,</i> are most commonlie put for illusion, false packing,
    cousenage, fraud, knaverie and deceipt: and is further driven to saie,
    that in ancient time, the learned were not so blockish, as not to see
    that the promises of magicians and inchanters were false, and nothing
    else but knaverie, cousenage, and old wives fables; and yet defendeth
    he their flieng in the aire, their transferring of corne or grasse from
    one feeld to another, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>But as Erastus disagreeth herein with himselfe and his freends: so is
    there no agreement among anie of those writers, but onlie in cruelties,
    absurdities, and impossibilities. And these (my Lord) that fall into so
    manifest contradictions, and into such absurd asseverations, are not
    of the inferior sort of writers; neither are they all papists, but men
    of such accompt, as whose names give more credit to their cause, than
    their writings. In whose behalfe I am sorie, and partlie for reverence
    suppresse their fondest errors and fowlest absurdities; dealing
    speciallie with them that most contend in crueltie,<sup>a</sup><span class="sni"><sup>a</sup> Isaie. 59, 7.<br />Rom. 3, 15.</span>
    whose feete are swift to shed bloud, striving (as
    <sup>b</sup><span class="sni"><sup>b</sup> Eccl. 27, 5.</span>Jesus the sonne of Sirach saith)
    and hasting (as <sup>c</sup><span class="sni"><sup>c</sup> Prov. 1, 16.</span>Salomon the sonne of David saith) to powre out the
    bloud of the innocent; whose heat against these poore wretches cannot
    be allaied with anie other liquor than bloud. And therfore I feare that
    <sup>d</sup><span class="sni"><sup>d</sup> Jer. 2, 34.</span>under their wings will be found the bloud of the soules of the
    poore, at that daie, when the Lord shall saie;/<span class="snp">A 4</span>
    <sup>e</sup><span class="sni"><sup>e</sup> Ps. 139, 15.<br />Esai. 33, 15.</span>Depart from me ye bloudthirstie men.</p>

  <p>And bicause I know your Lordship will take no counsell against innocent
    bloud, but rather suppresse them that seeke to embrue their hands
    therein; I have made choise to open their case unto you, and to laie
    their miserable calamitie before your feete: following herein the/<span class="snp" id="p_A_v">[<i>A.</i> v.]</span>
    advise of that learned man Brentius, who saith;
    <span class="sni"><i>In epistola ad Jo. Wier.</i></span><i>Si quis admonuerit
    magistratum, ne in miseras illas mulierculas sæviat, eum ego arbitror
    divinitùs excitatum</i>; that is, If anie admonish the magistrate not
    to deale too hardlie with these miserable wretches, that are called
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
    witches, I thinke him a good instrument raised up for this purpose by
    God himselfe.</p>

  <p>But it will perchance be said by witchmongers; to wit, by such as
    attribute to witches the power which apperteineth to God onelie, that
    I have made choise of your Lordship to be a patrone to this my booke;
    bicause I think you favour mine opinions, and by that meanes may the
    more freelie publish anie error or conceipt of mine owne, which should
    rather be warranted by your Lordships authoritie, than by the word of
    God, or by sufficient argument. But I protest the contrarie, and by
    these presents I renounce all protection, and despise all freendship
    that might serve to helpe towards the suppressing or supplanting of
    truth: knowing also that your Lordship is farre from allowing anie
    injurie done unto man; much more an enimie to them that go about to
    dishonor God, or to embezill the title of his immortall glorie. But
    bicause I know you to be perspicuous, and able to see downe into the
    depth and bottome of causes, and are not to be carried awaie with the
    vaine persuasion or superstition either of man, custome, time, or
    multitude, but mooved with the authoritie of truth onlie: I crave your
    countenance herein, even so farre foorth, and no further, than the lawe
    of God, the lawe of nature, the lawe of this land, and the/<span class="snp">A 4 v</span> rule of
    reason shall require. Neither doo I treat for these poore people anie
    otherwise, but so, as with one hand you may sustaine the good, and with
    the other suppresse the evill: wherein you shalbe thought a father to
    orphans, an advocate to widowes, a guide to the blind, a staie to the
    lame, a comfort &amp; countenance to the honest, a scourge/ and terror to
    the wicked.<span class="snp">[<i>A.</i> v. <i>v.</i>]</span></p>

  <p>Thus farre I have beene bold to use your Lordships patience, being
    offended with my selfe, that I could not in brevitie utter such
    matter as I have delivered amplie: whereby (I confesse) occasion of
    tediousnes might be ministred, were it not that your great gravitie
    joined with your singular constancie in reading and judging be means
    of the contrarie. And I wish even with all my hart, that I could make
    people conceive the substance of my writing, and not to misconstrue
    anie part of my meaning. Then doubtles would I persuade my selfe, that
    the companie of witchmongers, &amp;c: being once decreased, the number also
    of witches, &amp;c: would soone be diminished. But true be the words of the
    Poet,*<span class="sni">[* Homer.]</span></p>

  <p>And therefore as doubtfull to prevaile by persuading, though I have

    namelie, to all people an absolute trust in God the creator, and not

    Ir, I see among other malefactors manie poore old women convented
    before you for working of miracles, other wise called witchcraft,
    and therefore I thought you also a meet person to whom I might
    cōmend my booke. And here I have occasion to speake of your sincere
    administration of justice, and of your dexteritie, discretion, charge,
    and travell emploied in that behalfe, wherof I am oculatus testis.
    Howbeit I had rather refer the reader to common fame, and their owne
    eies and eares to be satisfied; than to send them to a Stationers
    shop, where manie times lies are vendible, and truth contemptible. For
    I being of your house, of your name, &amp; of your bloud; my foot being
    under your table, my hand in your dish, or rather in your pursse, might
    bee thought to flatter you in that, wherein (I knowe) I should rather
    offend you than please you. And what need I currie favour with my most
    assured friend? And if I should onelie publish those vertues (though
    they be manie) which give me speciall occasion to exhibit this my
    travell unto you, I should doo as a painter, that describeth the foot
    of a notable personage, and leaveth all the best features in his bodie
    untouched.</p>

  <p>I therefore (at this time) doo onelie desire you to consider of my
    report, concerning the evidence that is commonlie brought before you
    against them. See first whether the evidence be not frivolous, &amp;
    whether the proofs brought against them be not incredible, consisting
    of ghesses, presumptions, &amp; impossibilities contrarie to reason,
    scrip/ture,<span class="snp">A <i>a</i> 2</span> and nature. See also what persons complaine upon them,
    whether they be not of the basest, the unwisest, &amp; most faithles kind
    of people. Also/<span class="snp" id="p_A_vi_v">[<i>A.</i> vi. <i>v.</i>]</span> may it please you to waie what accusations and crimes
    they laie to their charge, namelie: She was at my house of late, she
    would have had a pot of milke, she departed in a chafe bicause she
    had it not, she railed, she curssed, she mumbled and whispered, and
    finallie she said she would be even with me: and soone after my child,
    my cow, my sow, or my pullet died, or was strangelie taken. Naie (if it
    please your Worship) I have further proofe: I was with a wise woman,
    and she told me I had an ill neighbour, &amp; that she would come to my
    house yer it were long, and so did she; and that she had a marke above
    hir waste, &amp; so had she: and God forgive me, my stomach hath gone
    against hir a great while. Hir mother before hir was counted a witch,
    she hath beene beaten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
    and scratched by the face till bloud was drawne
    upon hir, bicause she hath beene suspected, &amp; afterwards some of those
    persons were said to amend. These are the certeinties that I heare in
    their evidences.</p>

  <p>Note also how easilie they may be brought to confesse that which
    they never did, nor lieth in the power of man to doo: and then see
    whether I have cause to write as I doo. Further, if you shall see that
    infidelitie, poperie, and manie other manifest heresies be backed and
    shouldered, and their professors animated and hartened, by yeelding
    to creatures such infinit power as is wrested out of Gods hand, and
    attributed to witches: finallie, if you shall perceive that I have
    faithfullie and trulie delivered and set downe the condition and
    state of the witch, and also of the witchmonger, and have confuted by
    reason and lawe, and by the word of God it selfe, all mine adversaries
    objections and arguments: then let me have your countenance against
    them that maliciouslie oppose themselves against me./</p>

  <p>My greatest adversaries are yoong ignorance and old custome.<span class="snp">A <i>a</i> 2</span> For what
    follie soever tract of time hath fostered, it is/<span class="snp" id="p_A_vii">[<i>A.</i> vii.]</span> so superstitiouslie
    pursued of some, as though no error could be acquainted with custome.
    But if the lawe of nations would joine with such custome, to the
    maintenance of ignorance, and to the suppressing of knowledge; the
    civilest countrie in the world would soone become barbarous, &amp;c. For
    as knowledge and time discovereth errors, so dooth superstition and
    ignorance in time breed them. And concerning the opinions of such, as
    wish that ignorance should rather be mainteined, than knowledge busilie
    searched for, bicause thereby offense may grow: I answer,<span class="sni">John. 5.</span> that we are
    commanded by Christ himselfe to search for knowledge: <span class="sni">Prov. 15, 1.</span>for it is the
    kings honour (as Salomon saith) to search out a thing.</p>

  <p>Aristotle said to Alexander, that a mind well furnished was more
    beautifull than a bodie richlie araied. What can be more odious to
    man, or offensive to God, than ignorance: for through ignorance the
    Jewes did put Christ to death.<span class="sni">Acts. 3.<br />Proverbs. 9.</span>
    Which ignorance whosoever forsaketh, is
    promised life everlasting: and therfore among Christians it should be
    abhorred above all other things. For even as when we wrestle in the
    darke, we tumble in the mire, &amp;c: so when we see not the truth, we
    wallow in errors. A blind man may seeke long in the rishes yer he find
    a needle; and as soone is a doubt discussed by ignorance. Finallie,
    truth is no sooner found out in ignorance, than a sweet savor in a
    dunghill. And if they will allow men knowledge, and give them no leave
    to use it, men were much better be without it than have it.
    <span class="sni">Matth. 25.<br />Matth. 5.<br />Luke. 8.</span>For it is,
    as to have a tallent, and to hide it under the earth; or to put a
    candle under a bushell: or as to have a ship, &amp; to let hir lie
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span> alwaies
    in the docke: which thing how profitable it is, I can saie somewhat by
    experience./</p>

  <p>
    But hereof I need saie no more, for everie man seeth that<span class="snp">A <i>a</i> 2 v</span> none can
    be happie who knoweth not what felicitie meaneth. For what availeth
    it to have riches, and not to have the use/ thereof? <span class="snp" id="p_A_vii_v">[<i>A.</i> vii. <i>v.</i>]</span>Trulie the
    heathen herein deserved more commendation than manie christians, for
    they spared no paine, no cost, nor travell to atteine to knowledge.
    Pythagoras travelled from Thamus to Aegypt, and afterwards into Crete
    and Lacedæmonia: and Plato out of Athens into Italie and Aegypt, and
    all to find out hidden secrets and knowledge: which when a man hath,
    he seemeth to be separated from mortalitie. For pretious stones, and
    all other creatures of what value soever, are but counterfeits to this jewell: they
    are mortall, corruptible, and inconstant; this is immortall, pure
    and certeine. Wherfore if I have searched and found out any
    good thing, that ignorance and time hath smothered,
    the same I commend unto you: to whom
    though I owe all that I have, yet am
    I bold to make other partakers
    with you in this
    poore gift.

    Aving found out two such civill Magistrates, as for direction of
    judgement, and for ordering matters concerning justice in this common
    wealth (in my poore opinion) are verie singular persons, who (I hope)
    will accept of my good will, and examine my booke by their experience,
    as unto whom the matter therin conteined dooth greatlie apperteine: I
    have now againe considered of two other points: namelie, divinitie and
    philosophie, whereupon the groundworke of my booke is laid. Wherein
    although I know them to be verie sufficientlie informed, yet dooth
    not the judgement and censure of those causes so properlie apperteine
    to them as unto you, whose fame therein hath gotten preeminence above
    all others that I know of your callings: and in that respect I am bold
    to joine you with them, being all good neighbours togither in this
    commonwelth, and loving friends unto me. I doo not present this unto
    you, bicause it is meet for you; but for that you are meet for it
    (I meane) to judge upon it, to defend it, and if need be to correct
    it; knowing that you have learned of that grave counseller Cato, not
    to shame or discountenance any bodie. For if I thought you as readie,
    as able, to disgrace me for mine insufficiencie; I should not have
    beene hastie (knowing your learning) to have written unto you: but if I
    should be abashed to write to you, I should shew my selfe ignorant of
    your courtesie.</p>

  <p>I knowe mine owne weakenesse, which if it have beene able to mainteine
    this argument, the cause is the stronger. Eloquent words may please the
    eares, but sufficient matter persuadeth the hart. So as, if I exhibit
    wholsome drinke (thought it be small) in a treene*<span class="sni">[* = wooden]</span> dish with a
    faithfull hand, I hope it will bee as well accepted, as strong wine
    offered in a silver bowle with a flattering heart. And surelie it is a
    point of as great liberalitie to receive a small thing thankeful/lie,<span class="snp">A <i>a</i> 3 v.</span>
    as to give and distribute great and costlie gifts bountifullie: for
    there is more supplied with courteous answers than with rich rewards.
    The ty/rant<span class="snp">[<i>A.</i> viii. <i>v.</i>]</span>
    Dionysius was not so hated for his tyrannie, as for his
    churlish and strange behaviour. Among the poore Israelites sacrifices,
    God was satisfied with the tenth part of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>an Ephah of flower, so as it
    were fine and good. Christ liked well of the poore widowes mite, Lewis
    of France accepted a rape root of clownish Conan, Cyrus vouchsafed to
    drinke a cup of cold water out of the hand of poore Sinætes<i>:</i> and so
    it may please you to accept this simple booke at my hands, which I
    faithfullie exhibit unto you, not knowing your opinions to meet with
    mine, but knowing your learning and judgement to be able as well to
    correct me where I speake herein unskilfullie, as others when they
    speake hereof maliciouslie.</p>

  <p>Some be such dogs as they will barke at my writings, whether I
    mainteine or refute this argument: as Diogenes snarled both at the
    Rhodians and at the Lacedæmonians: at the one, bicause they were
    brave; at the other, bicause they were not brave. Homer himselfe
    could not avoid reprochfull speaches. I am sure that they which never
    studied to learne anie good thing, will studie to find faults hereat.
    I for my part feare not these wars, nor all the adversaries I have;
    were it not for certeine cowards, who (I knowe) will come behind my
    backe and bite me.</p>

  <p>But now to the matter. My question is not (as manie fondlie suppose)
    whether there be witches or naie: but whether they can doo such
    miraculous works as are imputed unto them. Good Maister Deane, is
    it possible for a man to breake his fast with you at Rochester, and
    to dine that day at Durham with Maister Doctor Matthew; or can
    your enimie maime you, when the Ocean sea is betwixt you? What reall
    communitie is betwixt a spirit and a bodie? May a spirituall bodie
    become temporall at his pleasure? Or may a carnall bodie become
    invisible? Is it likelie that the lives of all Princes, magistrates,
    &amp; subjects, should depend upon the will, or rather upon the wish of a
    poore malicious doting old foole; and that power exempted from the
    wise, the rich, the learned, the godlie, &amp;c? Finallie, is it possible
    for man or woman to do anie of those miracles expressed in my booke,
    &amp; so constantlie reported by great clarks? If you saie, no; then
    am I satisfied. If you saie that God, absolutelie, or by meanes can
    accomplish all those, and manie more, I go with you. But witches may
    well saie they can doo these things, howbeit they cannot shew how they
    doo them. If I for my part should saie I could doo/<span class="snp">A a 4.</span> those things, my
    verie adversaries would saie that I lied.</p>

  <p>O Maister Archdeacon, is it not pitie, that that which is said to be
    doone with the almightie power of the most high God, and by our saviour
    his onelie sonne Jesus Christ our Lord, shouldbe referred to a baggage
    old womans nod/<span class="snp"><i>B.</i> i.</span>
    or wish, &amp;c? Good Sir, is it not one manifest kind of
    Idolatrie, for them that labor and are laden, to come
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span> unto witches to
    be refreshed? If witches could helpe whom they are said to have made
    sicke, I see no reason, but remedie might as well be required at their
    hands, as a pursse demanded of him that hath stolne it. But trulie it
    is manifold idolatrie, to aske that of a creature, which none can give
    but the Creator. The papist hath some colour of scripture to mainteine
    his idoll of bread, but no Jesuiticall distinction can cover the
    witchmongers idolatrie in this behalfe. Alas, I am sorie and ashamed
    to see how manie die, that being said to be bewitched, onelie seeke
    for magicall cures, whom wholsome diet and good medicines would have
    recovered. I dare assure you both, that there would be none of these
    cousening kind of witches, did not witchmongers mainteine them, followe
    them, and beleeve in them and their oracles: whereby indeed all good
    learning and honest arts are overthrowne. For these that most advance
    their power, and mainteine the skill of these witches, understand no
    part thereof: and yet being manie times wise in other matters, are made
    fooles by the most fooles in the world.</p>

  <p>Me thinks these magicall physicians deale in the commonwelth, much
    like as a certeine kind of Cynicall people doo in the church, whose
    severe saiengs are accompted among some such oracles, as may not be
    doubted of; who in stead of learning and authoritie (which they
    make contemptible) doo feed the people with their owne devises and
    imaginations, which they prefer before all other divinitie: and
    labouring to erect a church according to their owne fansies, wherein
    all order is condemned, and onelie their magicall words and curious
    directions advanced, they would utterlie overthrowe the true Church.
    And even as these inchanting Paracelsians abuse the people, leading
    them from the true order of physicke to their charmes: so doo these
    other (I saie) dissuade from hearkening to learning and obedience, and
    whisper in mens eares to teach them their frierlike traditions. And of
    this sect the cheefe author at this time is/<span class="snp">A a 4 v</span> one Browne, a fugitive,
    a meet cover for such a cup: as heretofore the Anabaptists, the
    Arrians,*<span class="sni">[* Arians]</span> and the Franciscane friers.</p>

  <p>Trulie not onlie nature, being the foundation of all perfection; but
    also scripture, being the mistresse and director thereof, and of all
    christianitie, is beautified with knowledge and learning. For as nature
    without discipline dooth naturallie incline unto vanities, and as it
    were sucke up errors:<span class="sni">Rom. 2, 27.<br />2. Cor. 3, 6.</span>
    so doth the word, or rather the letter of the
    scripture, without understanding, not onlie make us devoure errors, but
    yeeldeth us up to death &amp; destruction: &amp; therefore Paule saith he was
    not a minister of the letter, but of the spirit.</p>

  <p>Thus have I beene bold to deliver unto the world, and to you, those
    simple/<span class="snp"><i>B.</i> i. v.</span> notes, reasons, and arguments, which I have devised or
    collected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
    out of other authors: which I hope shall be hurtfull to
    none, but to my selfe great comfort, if it may passe with good liking
    and acceptation. If it fall out otherwise, I should thinke my paines
    ill imploied. For trulie, in mine opinion, whosoever shall performe
    any thing, or atteine to anie knowledge; or whosoever should travell
    throughout all the nations of the world, or (if it were possible)
    should peepe into the heavens, the consolation or admiration thereof
    were nothing pleasant unto him, unles he had libertie to impart his
    knowledge to his friends. Wherein bicause I have made speciall choise
    of you, I hope you will read it, or at the least laie it up
    studie with your other bookes, among which therein your
    is none dedicated to any with more good will. And so
    long as you have it, it shall be untoyou (upon
    adventure of my life) a certeine amulet,
    periapt, circle, charme, &amp;c:
    to defend you from

    O you that are wise &amp; discreete few words may suffice: for such
    a one judgeth not at the first sight, nor reprooveth by heresaie;<span class="sni">Isai. 11.<br />Prover. 1.</span>
    but patientlie heareth, and thereby increaseth in understanding:
    which patience bringeth foorth experience, whereby true judgement is
    directed. I shall not need therefore to make anie further sute to you,
    but that it would please you to read my booke, without the prejudice
    of time, or former conceipt: and having obteined this at your hands, I
    submit my selfe unto your censure. But to make a solemne sute to you
    that are parciall readers, desiring you to set aside parcialitie, to
    take in good part my writing, and with indifferent eies to looke upon
    my booke, were labour lost, and time ill imploied. For I should no more
    prevaile herein, than if a hundred yeares since I should have intreated
    your predecessors to beleeve, that Robin goodfellowe, that great and
    ancient bulbegger, had beene but a cousening merchant, and no divell
    indeed.</p>

  <p>If I should go to a papist, and saie; I praie you beleeve my writings,
    wherein I will proove all popish charmes, conjurations, exorcismes,
    benedictions and cursses, not onelie to be ridiculous, and of none
    effect, but also to be impious and contrarie to Gods word: I should as
    hardlie therein win favour at their hands, as herein obteine credit at
    yours. Neverthelesse, I doubt not, but to/<span class="snp" id="p_B_ii_v"><i>B.</i> ii v.</span> use the matter so, that as
    well the massemoonger for his part, as the witchmoonger for his, shall
    both be ashamed of their professions.</p>

  <p>But Robin goodfellowe ceaseth now to be much feared, and poperie is
    sufficientlie discovered. Nevertheles, witches charms, and conjurors
    cousenages are yet thought effectuall. Yea the Gentiles have espied the
    fraud of their cousening oracles, and our cold prophets and inchanters
    make us fooles still, to the shame of us all, but speciallie of
    papists, who conjure everie thing, and thereby bring to passe nothing.
    They saie to their candles; I conjure you to endure for ever: and yet
    they last not a pater noster while the longer. They conjure water to be
    wholesome both for bodie and soule: but the bodie (we see) is never the
    better for it, nor the soule anie whit
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span> reformed by it. And therefore
    I mervell, that when they see their owne conjurations confuted and
    brought to naught, or at the least void of effect, that they (of all
    other) will yet give such credit, countenance, and authoritie to the
    vaine cousenages of witches and conjurors; as though their charmes and
    conjurations could produce more/ apparent, certeine, and better effects
    than their owne.<span class="snp">B v</span></p>

  <p>But my request unto all you that read my booke shall be no more, but
    that it would please you to conferre my words with your owne sense and
    experience, and also with the word of God. If you find your selves
    resolved and satisfied, or rather reformed and qualified in anie one
    point or opinion, that heretofore you held contrarie to truth, in a
    matter hitherto undecided, and never yet looked into; I praie you take
    that for advantage: and suspending your judgement, staie the sentence
    of condemnation against me, and consider of the rest, at your further
    leasure. If this may not suffice to persuade you, it cannot prevaile
    to annoy you: and then, that which is written without offense, may be
    overpassed without anie greefe.</p>

  <p>And although mine assertion, be somewhat differing from the old
    inveterat opinion, which I confesse hath manie graie heares, whereby
    mine adversaries have gained more authoritie than reason, towards the
    maintenance of their presumptions and old wives fables: yet shall it
    fullie agree with Gods glorie, and with his holie word. And albeit
    there be hold taken by mine adver/saries<span class="snp"><i>B.</i> iii.</span> of certeine few words or
    sentences in the scripture that maketh a shew for them: yet when the
    whole course thereof maketh against them, and impugneth the same, yea
    and also their owne places rightlie understood doo nothing at all
    releeve them: I trust their glorious title and argument of antiquitie
    will appeare as stale and corrupt as the apothecaries drugs, or grocers
    spice, which the longer they be preserved, the woorsse they are. And
    till you have perused my booke, ponder this in your mind, to wit, that
    <i>Sagæ</i>, <i>Thessalæ</i>, <i>Striges</i>, <i>Lamiæ</i> (which words and none other
    being in use do properlie signifie our witches) are not once found
    written in the old or new testament; and that Christ himselfe in his
    gospell never mentioned the name of a witch. And that neither he, nor
    Moses ever spake anie one word of the witches bargaine with the divell,
    their hagging, their riding in the aire, their transferring of corne or
    grasse from one feeld to another, their hurting of children or cattell
    with words or charmes, their bewitching of butter, cheese, ale, &amp;c:
    nor yet their transubstantiation;<span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef. par. 2. quæ. 2.</i></span> insomuch as the writers hereupon are
    not ashamed to say, that it is not absurd to affirme that there were
    no witches in Jobs time. The reason is, that if there had beene such
    witches then in beeing, Job would have said he had beene bewitched. But
    indeed men tooke no heed in those daies to this
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">xxii</span> doctrine of divels;<span class="sni">1. Pet. 4. 1.</span>
    to wit, to these fables of witchcraft, which Peter saith shall be much
    regarded and hearkened unto in the latter daies.</p>

  <p>Howbeit, how ancient so ever this barbarous conceipt of witches
    omnipotencie is, truth must not be measured by time: for everie old
    opinion is not sound. Veritie is not impaired, how long so ever it be
    suppressed; but is to be searched out, in how darke a corner so ever it
    lie hidden: for it is not like a cup of ale, that may be broched too
    rathe. Finallie, time bewraieth old errors, &amp; discovereth new matters
    of truth. <span class="sni"><i>Danæus in suo prologo.</i></span>Danæus himselfe saith, that this question hitherto hath never
    beene handled; nor the scriptures concerning this matter have never
    beene expounded. To prove the antiquitie of the cause, to confirme
    the opini/on<span class="snp">B 2</span> of the ignorant, to inforce mine adversaries arguments,
    to aggravate the punishments, &amp; to accomplish the confusiō of these
    old women, is added the vanitie and wickednes of them, which are
    called witches, the arrogancie of those which take upon them to/<span class="snp"><i>B.</i> iii. v.</span> worke
    wonders, the desire that people have to hearken to such miraculous
    matters, unto whome most commonlie an impossibilitie is more credible
    than a veritie; the ignorance of naturall causes, the ancient and
    universall hate conceived against the name of a witch; their ilfavoured
    faces, their spitefull words, their cursses and imprecations, their
    charmes made in ryme, and their beggerie; the feare of manie foolish
    folke, the opinion of some that are wise, the want of Robin goodfellowe
    and the fairies, which were woont to mainteine chat, and the common
    peoples talke in this behalfe; the authoritie of the inquisitors,
    the learning, cunning, consent, and estimation of writers herein,
    the false translations and fond interpretations used, speciallie by
    papists; and manie other like causes. All which toies take such hold
    upon mens fansies, as whereby they are lead and entised awaie from the
    consideration of true respects, to the condemnation of that which they
    know not.</p>

  <p>Howbeit, I will (by Gods grace) in this my booke, so apparentlie
    decipher and confute these cavils, and all other their objections;
    as everie witchmoonger shall be abashed, and all good men thereby
    satisfied. In the meane time, I would wish them to know that if neither
    the estimation of Gods omnipotencie, nor the tenor of his word, nor the
    doubtfulnes or rather the impossibilitie of the case, nor the small
    proofes brought against them, nor the rigor executed upon them, nor the
    pitie that should be in a christian heart, nor yet their simplicitie,
    impotencie, or age may suffice to suppresse the rage or rigor wherewith
    they are oppressed; yet the consideration of their sex or kind ought
    to moove some mitigatiō of their punishment. For if nature (as Plinie
    reporteth) have taught a lion not to deale so roughlie with a woman as
    with a man, bicause she is in bodie the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</span> weaker vessell, and in hart
    more inclined to pitie (which Jeremie<span class="sni">Lam. Jer. 3. &amp; 4. cap. verse. 10<br />1. Cor 11. 9.<br />
    Ibid. vers. 7.<br />Ge. 2. 22. 18.<br /><i>Arist. lib. problem. 2. 9.</i></span>
    in his lamentations seemeth to
    confirme) what should a man doo in this case, for whome a woman was
    created as an helpe and comfort unto him? In so much as, even in the
    lawe of nature, it is a greater offense to slea a woman than a man:
    not bicause a man is not the more excellent creature, but bicause a
    woman is the weaker vessell. And therefore among all modest and honest
    persons it is thought a shame to offer violence or injurie to a woman:<span class="sni"><i>Vir. Georg.</i></span>
    in which respect Virgil/<span class="snp">[<i>B.</i> iv.]</span> saith, <i>Nullum memorabile nomen fæminea in
      pæna est</i>.</p>

  <p>God that knoweth my heart is witnes, and you that read my booke shall
    see, that my drift and purpose in this enterprise tendeth onelie to
    these respects. First, that the glorie and power of God be not so
    abridged and abased, as to be thrust into the hand or lip of a lewd old
    woman: whereby the worke of the Creator should be attributed to the
    power of a creature. Secondlie, that the religion of the gospell may be
    seene to stand without such peevish trumperie. Thirdlie, that lawfull
    favour and christian compassion be rather used towards these poore
    soules, than rigor and extremitie. Bicause they, which are commonlie
    accused of witchcraft,/<span class="snp">B 2 v</span> are the least sufficient of all other persons
    to speake for themselves; as having the most base and simple education
    of all others; the extremitie of their age giving them leave to dote,
    their povertie to beg, their wrongs to chide and threaten (as being
    void of anie other waie of revenge) their humor melancholicall to be
    full of imaginations, from whence cheefelie proceedeth the vanitie of
    their confessions; as that they can transforme themselves and others
    into apes, owles, asses, dogs, cats, &amp;c: that they can flie in the
    aire, kill children with charmes, hinder the comming of butter, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>And for so much as the mightie helpe themselves together, and the
    poore widowes crie,<span class="sni">Eccl[us.] 35, 15.</span>
    though it reach to heaven, is scarse heard here
    upon earth: I thought good (according to my poore abilitie) to make
    intercession, that some part of common rigor, and some points of hastie
    judgement may be advised upon. For the world is now at that stay (as
    Brentius in a most godlie sermon in these words affirmeth) that even
    as when the heathen persecuted the christians, if anie were accused
    to beleeve in Christ, the common people cried <i>Ad leonem</i>: so now, if
    anie woman, be she never so honest, be accused of witchcraft, they crie
    <i>Ad ignem</i>. What difference is betweene the rash dealing of unskilfull
    people, and the grave counsell of more discreet and learned persons,
    may appeare by a tale of Danæus his owne telling; wherein he opposeth
    the rashnes of a few townesmen, to the counsell of a whole senate,
    preferring the follie of the one, before the wisdome of the other.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</span></p>

  <p>At Orleance on Loyre (saith he) there was a manwitch, not only/<span class="snp">[<i>B.</i> iv. <i>v.</i>]</span>
    taken and accused, but also convicted and condemned for witchcraft, who
    appealed from thence to the high court of Paris. Which accusation the
    senate sawe insufficient, and would not allow, but laughed thereat,
    lightlie regarding it; and in the end sent him home (saith he) as
    accused of a frivolous matter. And yet for all that, the magistrats of
    Orleance were so bold with him, as to hang him up within short time
    after, for the same or the verie like offense. In which example is to
    be seene the nature, and as it were the disease of this cause: wherein
    (I saie) the simpler and undiscreeter sort are alwaies more hastie &amp;
    furious in judgements, than men of better reputation and knowledge.
    Nevertheles, Eunichius saith, that these three things; to wit, what is
    to be thought of witches, what their incantations can doo, and whether
    their punishment should extend to death, are to be well considered.
    And I would (saith he) they were as well knowne, as they are rashlie
    beleeved, both of the learned, and unlearned. And further he saith,
    that almost all divines, physicians and lawyers, who should best know
    these matters, satisfieng themselves with old custome, have given too
    much credit to these fables, and too rash and unjust sentence of death
    upon witches. But when a man pondereth (saith he) that in times past,
    all that swarved from the church of Rome were judged heretikes; it is
    the lesse marvell, though in this matter they be blind and ignorant.</p>

  <p>And surelie, if the scripture had beene longer suppressed, more absurd
    fables would have sproong up, and beene beleeved. Which credulitie
    though it is to be derided with laughter; yet this their crueltie is
    to be/<span class="snp">B 3</span> lamented with teares. For (God knoweth) manie of these poore
    wretches had more need to be releeved than chastised; and more meete
    were a preacher to admonish them, than a gailor to keepe them; and
    a physician more necessarie to helpe them, than an executioner or
    tormentor to hang or burne them. For proofe and due triall hereof, I
    will requite Danæus his tale of a manwitch (as he termeth him) with
    another witch of the same sex or gender.</p>

  <p>Cardanus<span class="sni"><i>Lib. 15. cap. 18. de varietatib. rerum.</i></span>
    from the mouth of his owne father reporteth, that one Barnard,
    a poore servant, being in wit verie simple and rude, but in his service
    verie necessarie and diligent (and in that respect deerelie beloved of
    his maister) professing the art of witchcraft,/<span class="snp" id="p_B_v">[<i>B.</i> v.]</span> could in no wise be
    dissuaded from that profession, persuading himselfe that he knew all
    things, and could bring anie matter to passe; bicause certeine countrie
    people resorted to him for helpe and counsell, as supposing by his owne
    talke, that he could doo somewhat. At length he was condemned to be
    burned: which torment he seemed more willing to suffer, than to loose
    his estimation in that behalfe. But his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">xxv</span>
    maister having compassion
    upon him, and being himselfe in his princes favor, perceiving his
    conceipt to proceed of melancholie, obteined respit of execution for
    twentie daies. In which time (saith he) his maister bountifullie fed
    him with good fat meat, and with foure egs at a meale, as also with
    sweet wine: which diet was best for so grosse and weake a bodie. And
    being recovered so in strength, that the humor was suppressed, he was
    easilie woone from his absurd and dangerous opinions, and from all his
    fond imaginations: and confessing his error and follie, from the which
    before no man could remoove him by anie persuasions, having his pardon,
    he lived long a good member of the church, whome otherwise the crueltie
    of judgement should have cast awaie and destroied.</p>

  <p>This historie is more credible than Sprengers fables, or Bodins bables,
    which reach not so far to the extolling of witches omnipotencie, as to
    the derogating of Gods glorie. For if it be true, which they affirme,
    that our life and death lieth in the hand of a witch; then is it false,
    that God maketh us live or die, or that by him we have our being, our
    terme of life appointed, and our daies numbred. But surelie their
    charmes can no more reach to the hurting or killing of men or women,
    than their imaginations can extend to the stealing and carrieng awaie
    of horsses &amp; mares. Neither hath God given remedies to sicknes or
    greefes, by words or charmes, but by hearbs and medicines;<span class="sni">Amos. 3. 6.<br />La. Jer. 3. 38.<br />Isai. 45. 9.<br />Rom. 9. 20.</span>
    which he himselfe hath created upon earth, and given men knowledge of the same;
    that he might be glorified, for that therewith he dooth vouchsafe that
    the maladies of men and cattell should be cured, &amp;c. And if there be
    no affliction nor calamitie, but is brought to passe by him, then let
    us defie the divell, renounce all his works, and not so much as once
    thinke or dreame upon this supernaturall power of witches; neither let
    us prosecute them with such despight, whome our fansie condemneth,
    and our reason acquiteth: our/<span class="snp">[<i>B</i> v. <i>v.</i>]</span>
    evidence against them consisting in
    impossibilities, our proofes in unwritten verities, and our whole
    proceedings in doubts and difficulties./</p>

  <p><span class="snp">B 3. v.</span>Now bicause I mislike the extreame crueltie used against some of these
    sillie soules (whome a simple advocate having audience and justice
    might deliver out of the hands of the inquisitors themselves) it will
    be said, that I denie anie punishment at all to be due to anie witch
    whatsoever. Naie, bicause I bewraie the follie and impietie of them,
    which attribute unto witches the power of God: these witchmoongers
    will report, that I denie there are anie witches at all: and yet
    behold (saie they) how often is this word [Witch]*<span class="sni">* [] in text.</span> mentioned in the
    scriptures? Even as if an idolater should saie in the behalfe of images
    and idols, to them which denie their power and godhead, and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</span> inveigh
    against the reverence doone unto them; How dare you denie the power of
    images, seeing their names are so often repeated in the scriptures? But
    truelie I denie not that there are witches or images: but I detest the
    idolatrous opinions conceived of them; referring that to Gods worke and
    ordinance, which they impute to the power and malice of witches; and
    attributing that honour to God, which they ascribe to idols. But as
    for those that in verie deed are either witches or conjurors, let them
    hardlie suffer such punishment as to their fault is agreeable, and as
    by the grave judgement of lawe is provided.</p>

    HE fables of Witchcraft have taken so fast hold and deepe root in
    the heart of man, that fewe or none can (nowadaies) with patience
    indure the hand and correction of God. For if any adversitie, greefe,
    sicknesse, losse of children, corne, cattell, or libertie happen vnto
    them; by &amp; by they exclaime uppon witches. <span class="sni">Job. 5.</span>As though there were no God
    in Israel that ordereth all things according to his will; punishing
    both just and unjust with greefs, plagues, and afflictions in maner and
    forme as he thinketh good: but that certeine old women heere on earth,
    called witches, must needs be the contrivers of all mens calamities,
    and as though they themselves were innocents, and had deserved no such
    punishments. Insomuch as they sticke not to ride and go to such, as
    either are injuriouslie tearmed witches, or else are willing so to be
    accounted, seeking at their hands comfort and remedie in time of their
    tribulation, <span class="sni">Matth. 11.</span>contrarie to Gods will and commandement in that behalfe,
    who bids us resort to him in all/<span class="snp" id="p_2"><i>2.</i></span> our necessities.</p>

  <p>Such faithlesse people (I saie) are also persuaded, that neither haile
    nor snowe, thunder nor lightening, raine nor tempestuous winds come
    from the heavens at the commandement of God: but are raised by the
    cunning and power of witches and conjurers; insomuch as a clap of
    thunder, or a gale of wind is no sooner heard, but either they run to
    ring bels, or crie out to burne witches; or else burne consecrated
    things, hoping by the smoke thereof, to drive the divell out of the
    aire, as though spirits could be fraied awaie with such externall
    toies: howbeit, these are right inchantments, as <i>Brentius</i> affirmeth.
    <span class="sni"><i>In concione.</i></span></p>

  <p>But certeinlie, it is neither a witch, nor divell, but a glorious<sup>a</sup><span class="sni"><sup>a</sup> Psal. 25.</span>
    God that maketh the thunder. I have read in the scriptures, that God<sup>b</sup><span class="sni"><sup>b</sup> Psal. 83.</span>
    maketh the blustering tempests and whirlewinds: and I find that it is<sup>c</sup><span class="sni"><sup>c</sup> Eccles. 43.</span>
    the Lord that altogither dealeth with them, and that they<sup>d</sup><span class="sni"><sup>d</sup> Luke. 8.<br />Matth. 8.</span>
    blowe according to his will. But let me see anie of them all<sup>e</sup><span class="sni"><sup>e</sup> Mark. 4. 41.<br />Luke. 8. 14.</span>
    rebuke and still the sea in time of tempest, as Christ did; or raise the stormie wind, as <sup>f</sup>God<span class="sni"><sup>f</sup> Psal. 170.</span>
    did with his word; and I will beleeve in them. Hath <span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
    anie witch or conjurer, or anie creature entred into the <sup>g</sup>treasures
    <span class="sni"><sup>g</sup> Job. 38, 22.</span> of the snowe; or seene/<span class="snp"><b>2.</b></span> the secret places of the haile,
    which GOD hath prepared against the daie of trouble, battell, and
    warre? I for my part also thinke with Jesus Sirach,<span class="sni">Eccles. 43.</span> that at Gods onelie
    commandement the snowe falleth; and that the wind bloweth according to
    his will, who onelie maketh all stormes to cease; and<sup>h</sup><span class="sni"><sup>h</sup> Leviti. 26. verse. 3, 4.</span> who (if we
    keepe his ordinances) will send us raine in due season, and make the
    land to bring forth hir increase, and the trees of the field to give
    their fruit.</p>

  <p>But little thinke our witchmongers, that the <sup>i</sup>Lord<span class="sni"><sup>i</sup> Psal. 78, 23.</span>
    commandeth the clouds above, or openeth the doores of heaven, as <i>David</i> affirmeth; or
    that the Lord goeth forth in the tempests and stormes, as the Prophet
    <sup>k</sup><i>Nahum</i><span class="sni"><sup>k</sup> Nahum. 1.</span>
    reporteth: but rather that witches and conjurers are then
    about their businesse.</p>

  <p>The <i>Martionists</i> acknowledged one God the authour of good things, and
    another the ordeiner of evill: but these make the divell a whole god,
    to create things of nothing, to knowe mens cogitations, and to doo
    that which God never did; as, to transubstantiate men into beasts, &amp;c.
    Which thing if divels could doo,/<span class="snp" id="p_3"><i>3.</i></span> yet followeth it not, that witches
    have such power. But if all the divels in hell were dead, and all the
    witches in <i>England</i> burnt or hanged; I warrant you we should not faile
    to have raine, haile and tempests, as now we have: according to the
    appointment and will of God, and according to the constitution of the
    elements, and the course of the planets, wherein God hath set a perfect
    and perpetuall order.</p>

  <p>I am also well assured, that if all the old women in the world were
    witches; and all the priests, conjurers: we should not have a drop of
    raine, nor a blast of wind the more or the lesse for them. For <sup>l</sup>the
    <span class="sni"><sup>l</sup> Job. 26, 8.<br />Job. 37.<br />Psalme. 135.<br />Jer. 10 &amp; 15.</span>
    Lord hath bound the waters in the clouds, and hath set bounds about
    the waters, untill the daie and night come to an end: yea it is God
    that raiseth the winds and stilleth them: and he saith to the raine and
    snowe; Be upon the earth, and it falleth. The <sup>m</sup>wind<span class="sni"><sup>m</sup> Ose. 13.</span> of the Lord, and
    not the wind of witches, shall destroie the treasures of their plesant
    vessels, and drie up the fountaines; saith <i>Oseas</i>. Let us also learne
    and confesse with the Prophet <i>David</i>, that we<sup>n</sup><span class="sni"><sup>n</sup> Psa. 39, &amp;c.</span> our selves are the
    causes of our afflictions; and not exclaime upon witches, when we
    should call upon God for mercie.</p>

  <p>The Imperiall lawe (saith <i>Brentius</i>)<span class="sni"><i>In epist. ad Jo. Wierum.</i></span> condemneth them to death that
    trouble and infect the aire: but I affirme (saith he) that it is
    neither in the power of witch not divell so to doo, but in God onelie.
    Though (besides <i>Bodin</i>, and all the popish writers in generall) it
    please <i>Danæus</i>, <i>Hyperius</i>, <i>Hemingius</i>, <i>Erastus</i>, &amp;c. to conclude
    otherwise. The clouds<sup>o</sup><span class="sni"><sup>o</sup> Exod. 13.<br />Isai. 66.<br />Ps. 18, 11. 19.</span>
    are called the pillers of Gods tents, Gods
    chariots, and his pavillions. And if it be so, what witch or divell can <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
    make maisteries therof? S. <i>Augustine</i> saith, <span class="sni"><i>August. 3. de sancta Trinit.</i></span><i>Non est putandum
    istis transgressoribus angelis servire hanc rerum visibilium materiem,
    sed soli Deo</i>: We must not thinke that these visible things are at the
    commandement of the angels that fell, but are obedient to the onelie
    God.</p>

  <p>Finallie, if witches could accomplish these things; what needed it
    seeme so strange to the people, when Christ by miracle <sup>p</sup>commanded<span class="sni"><sup>p</sup> Mar. 4, 41.</span>
    both seas and winds, &amp;c. For it is written; Who is this? for both wind
    and sea obeie him./</p>

    UT the world is now so bewitched and over-run with this fond error,
    that even where a man shuld seeke comfort and counsell, there shall hee
    be sent (in case of necessitie) from God to the divell; and from the
    Physician, to the coosening witch, who will not sticke to take upon
    hir, by wordes to heale the lame (which was proper onelie to Christ;
    and to them whom he assisted with his divine power) yea, with hir
    familiar &amp; charmes she will take upon hir to cure the blind: though
    in the <sup>a</sup>tenth<span class="sni"><sup>a</sup> Joh. 10, 21.</span> of S. <i>Johns</i> Gospell it be written, that the divell
    cannot open the eies of the blind. And they attaine such credit as I
    have heard (to my greefe) some of the ministerie affirme, that they
    have had in their parish at one instant, xvii. or xviii. witches:
    meaning such as could worke miracles supernaturallie. Whereby they
    manifested as well their infidelitie and ignorance, in conceiving Gods
    word; as their negligence and error in instructing their flocks. For
    they themselves might understand, and also teach their parishoners,
    that <sup>b</sup>God<span class="sni"><sup>b</sup> Psal. 72, &amp; 136.<br />Jeremie, 5.</span> onelie worketh great woonders; and that it is he which
    sendeth such punishments to the wicked, and such trials to the elect:
    according to the saieng of the Prophet <i>Haggai</i>,<sup>c</sup><span class="sni"><sup>c</sup> Hag. 2, 28.</span> I smote you with
    blasting and mildeaw, and with haile, in all the labours of your hands;
    and yet you turned not unto me, saith the Lord. And therefore saith the

    and proofes are used and made. But more shalbe said of this hereafter.</p>

  <p>S. <i>Paule</i> fore-sawe the blindnesse and obstinacie, both of these blind

    (as witches and conjurers doo) but cast thou awaie such prophane and
    old wives fables. In which sense Basil saith; Who so giveth heed to
    inchanters, hearkeneth to a fabulous and frivolous thing. But I will
    rehearse an example whereof I my selfe am not onelie <i>Oculatus testis</i>,
    but have examined the cause, and am to justifie the truth of my report:
    not bicause I would disgrace the ministers that are godlie, but to
    confirme my former assertion, that this absurd error is growne into the
    place, which should be able to expell all such ridiculous follie and
    impietie.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">A storie of Margaret Simons, a supposed witch.</span>
    At the assises holden at <i>Rochester</i>, Anno 1581, one <i>Margaret
    Simons</i>,/ the wife of <i>John Simons</i>, of <i>Brenchlie</i> in <i>Kent</i>, was
    araigned for witchcraft, at the instigation and complaint of divers
    fond and malicious persons; and speciallie by the meanes of one <i>John
    Ferrall</i> vicar of that parish: with whom I talked about that matter,
    and found him both fondlie assotted in the cause, and enviouslie bent
    towards hir: and (which is worse) as unable to make a good account of
    his faith, as shee whom he accused. That which he, for his part, laid
    to the poore womans charge, was this.</p>

  <p>His sonne (being an ungratious boie, and prentise to one <i>Robert
      Scotchford</i> clothier, dwelling in that parish of <i>Brenchlie</i>) passed on
    a daie by hir house; at whome by chance hir little dog barked. Which
    thing the boie taking in evill part, drewe his knife, &amp; pursued him
    therewith even to hir doore: whom she rebuked with some such words
    as the boie disdained, &amp; yet neverthelesse would not be persuaded
    to depart in a long time. At the last he returned to his maisters
    house, and within five or sixe daies fell sicke. Then was called to
    mind the fraie betwixt the dog and the boie: insomuch as the vicar
    (who thought himselfe so privileged, as he little mistrusted that God
    would visit his children with sicknes) did so calculate; as he found,
    partlie through his owne judgement, and partlie (as he himselfe told/<span class="snp" id="p_6"><i>6.</i></span>
    me) by the relation of other witches, that his said sonne was by hir
    bewitched. Yea, he also told me, that this his sonne (being as it were
    past all cure) received perfect health at the hands of another witch.</p>

  <p>He proceeded yet further against hir, affirming, that alwaies in his
    parish church, when he desired to read most plainelie, his voice so
    failed him, as he could scant be heard at all. Which hee could impute,
    he said, to nothing else, but to hir inchantment. When I advertised the
    poore woman hereof, as being desirous to heare what she could saie for
    hir selfe; she told me, that in verie deed his voice did much faile
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
    him, speciallie when he strained himselfe to speake lowdest. How beit,
    she said that at all times his voice was hoarse and lowe: which thing
    I perceived to be true. But sir, said she, you shall understand, that
    this our vicar is diseased with such a kind of hoarsenesse, as divers
    of our neighbors in this parish, not long since, doubted that he had
    the French pox; &amp; in that respect utterly refused to communicate with
    him: untill such time as (being therunto injoined by M. D. <i>Lewen</i> the
    Ordinarie) he had brought frō <i>London</i> a certificat, under the hands
    of two physicians, that his hoarsenes proceeded from a disease in the
    lungs. Which certificat he published in the church, in the presence of
    the whole congregation: and by this meanes hee was cured, or rather
    excused of the shame of his disease. And this I knowe to be true by the
    relation of divers honest men of that parish. And truelie, if one of
    the Jurie had not beene wiser than the other, she had beene condemned
    thereupon, and upon other as ridiculous matters as this. For the name
    of a witch is so odious, and hir power so feared among the common
    people, that if the honestest bodie living chance to be arraigned
    therupon, she shall hardlie escape condemnation./</p>

    NE sort of such as are said to bee witches, are women which be
    commonly old, lame, bleare-eied, pale, fowle, and full of wrinkles;
    poore, sullen, superstitious, and papists; or such as knowe no
    religion: in whose drousie minds the divell hath goten a fine seat;
    so as, what mischeefe, mischance, calamitie, or slaughter is brought
    to passe, they are easilie persuaded the same is doone by themselves;
    inprinting in their minds<span class="sni"><i>Cardan. de var. rerum.</i></span>
    an earnest and constant imagination hereof.
    They are leane and deformed, shewing melancholie in their faces, to the
    horror of all that see them. They are doting, scolds, mad, divelish;
    and not much differing from them that are thought to be possessed with
    spirits; so firme and stedfast in their opinions, as whosoever shall
    onelie have respect to the constancie of their words uttered, would
    easilie beleeve they were true indeed.</p>

  <p>These miserable wretches are so odious unto all their neighbors, and so
    feared, as few dare offend them, or denie them anie thing they aske:
    whereby they take upon them; yea, and sometimes thinke, that they can
    doo such things as are beyond the abilitie of humane
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> nature. These go
    from house to house, and from doore to doore for a pot full of milke,
    yest, drinke, pottage, or some such releefe; without the which they
    could hardlie live: neither obtaining for their service and paines, nor
    by their art, nor yet at the divels hands (with whome they are said to
    make a perfect and visible bargaine) either beautie, monie, promotion,
    welth, worship, pleasure, honor, knowledge, learning, or anie other
    benefit whatsoever./<span class="snp" id="p_8"><i>8.</i></span></p>

  <p>It falleth out many times, that neither their necessities, nor their
    expectation is answered or served, in those places where they beg or
    borrowe; but rather their lewdnesse is by their neighbors reprooved.
    And further, in tract of time the witch waxeth odious and tedious
    to hir neighbors; and they againe are despised and despited of hir:
    so as sometimes she cursseth one, and sometimes another; and that
    from the maister of the house, his wife, children, cattell, &amp;c. to
    the little pig that lieth in the stie. Thus in processe of time they
    have all displeased hir, and she hath wished evill lucke unto them
    all; perhaps with cursses and imprecations made in forme. Doubtlesse
    (at length) some of hir neighbors die, or fall sicke; or some of
    their children are visited with diseases that vex them strangelie: as
    apoplexies, epilepsies, convulsions, hot fevers, wormes, &amp;c. Which
    by ignorant parents are supposed to be the vengeance of witches.
    Yea and their opinions and conceits are/ confirmed and maintained
    by unskilfull physicians: according to the common saieng; <i>Inscitiæ
    pallium maleficium &amp; incantatio</i>, Witchcraft and inchantment is the
    cloke of ignorance: whereas indeed evill humors, &amp; not strange words,
    witches, or spirits are the causes of such diseases. Also some of their
    cattell perish, either by disease or mischance. Then they, upon whom
    such adversities fall, weighing the fame that goeth upon this woman
    (hir words, displeasure, and cursses meeting so justlie with their
    misfortune) doo not onelie conceive, but also are resolved, that all
    their mishaps are brought to passe by hir onelie meanes.</p>

  <p>The witch on the other side exspecting hir neighbours mischances, and
    seeing things sometimes come to passe according to hir wishes, cursses,
    and incantations (for <i>Bodin</i><span class="sni"><i>Bodin. li. 2. de dæmono: cap. 8.</i></span>
    himselfe confesseth, that not above two

    before a Justice, by due examination of the circumstances is driven
    to see hir imprecations and desires, and hir neighbors harmes and
    losses to concurre, and as it were to take effect: and so confesseth
    that she (as a goddes) hath brought such things to passe. Wherein, not
    onelie she, but the accuser, and also the Justice are fowlie deceived
    and abused; as being thorough hir confession and other circumstances

  <p>Another sort of witches there are, which be absolutelie cooseners.
    These take upon them, either for glorie, fame, or gaine, to doo anie
    thing, which God or the divell can doo: either for foretelling of
    things to come, bewraieng of secrets, curing of maladies, or working of
    miracles. But of these I will talke more at large heereafter.</p>


  <h3>The fourth Chapter.</h3>

  <p class="subhead"><i>What miraculous actions are imputed to witches by
    witchmongers, papists, and poets.</i></p>

    LTHOUGH it be quite against the haire, and contrarie to the divels
    will, contrarie to the witches oth, promise, and homage, and contrarie
    to all reason, that witches should helpe anie thing that is bewitched;
    but rather set forward their maisters businesse: yet we read <i>In malleo
    maleficarum</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Mal. Malef. par. 2. quæst. 1. cap, 2.</i></span>
    of three sorts of witches; and the same is affirmed by
    all the writers heereupon, new and old. One sort (they say) can hurt
    and not helpe, the second can helpe and not hurt, the third can both
    helpe and hurt. And among the hurtfull witches he saith there is one
    sort more beastlie than any kind of beasts, saving woolves: for these
    usuallie devoure and eate yong children and infants of their owne kind.
    These be they (saith he) that raise haile, tempests, and hurtfull
    weather; as lightening, thunder, &amp;c. These be they that procure
    barrennesse in man, woman, and beast. These can throwe children into
    waters, as they walke with their mothers, and/<span class="snp"><b>7.</b></span> not be seene. These can
    make horsses kicke, till they cast the riders. These can passe from
    place to place in the aire invisible. These can so alter the mind of
    judges, that they can have no power to hurt them. These can procure
    to themselves and to others, taciturnitie and insensibilitie in their
    torments. These can bring trembling to the hands, and strike terror
    into the minds of them that apprehend them. These can manifest unto
    others, things hidden and lost, and foreshew/<span class="snp" id="p_10"><i>10.</i></span> things to come; and
    see them as though they were present. These can alter mens minds to
    inordinate love or hate. These can kill whom they list with lightening
    and thunder. These can take awaie mans courage, and the power of
    generation. These can make a woman miscarrie in childbirth, and
    destroie the child in the mothers wombe, without any sensible meanes
    either inwardlie or outwardlie applied. These can with their looks kill
    either man or beast.</p>

  <p>All these things are avowed by <i>James Sprenger</i> and <i>Henrie Institor</i>
    <i>In malleo maleficarum</i>, to be true, &amp; confirmed by <i>Nider</i>, and the
    inquisitor <i>Cumanus</i>; and also by <i>Danæus</i>, <i>Hyperius</i>, <i>Hemingius</i>,
    and multiplied by <i>Bodinus</i>, and frier <i>Bartholomæus Spineus</i>. But
    bicause I will in no wise abridge the authoritie of their power, you
    shall have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>

    first <i>Ovid</i> affirmeth, that they can raise and suppresse
    lightening and thunder, raine and haile, clouds and winds, tempests and
    earthquakes. Others doo write, that they can pull downe the moone and
    the starres. Some write that with wishing they can send needles into
    the livers of their enimies. Some that they can transferre corne in
    the blade from one place to another. Some, that they can cure diseases
    supernaturallie, flie in the aire, and danse with divels. Some write,
    that they can plaie the part of <i>Succubus</i>, and contract themselves to
    <i>Incubus</i>; and so yoong prophets are upon them begotten, &amp;c. Som saie
    they can transubstantiate themselves and others, and take the forms and
    shapes of asses, woolves, ferrets, cowes, apes, horsses, dogs, &amp;c. Some
    say they can keepe divels and spirits in the likenesse of todes and
    cats.</p>

  <p>They can raise spirits (as others affirme) drie up springs, turne the
    course of running waters, inhibit the sunne, and staie both day and
    night, changing the one into the other. They can go in and out at awger
    holes, &amp; saile in an egge shell, a cockle or muscle shell, through and
    under the tempestuous seas. They can go invisible, and deprive men of
    their privities, and otherwise of the act and use of venerie. They can
    bring soules out of the graves. They can teare snakes in peeces with
    words, and with looks kill lambes. But in this case a man may saie,
    that <i>Miranda canunt</i>/<span class="snp" id="p_11"><i>11.</i></span>

    passe, that chearne as long as you list, your butter will not come;
    especiallie, if either the maids have eaten up the creame; or the

    some triall, although there may be true and naturall causes to hinder
    the common course thereof: as for example. Put a little sope or sugar
    into your chearne of creame, and there will never come anie butter, chearne as

  <p class="subhead"><i>A confutation of the common conceived opinion of witches and
    witchcraft, and how detestable a sinne it is to repaire to
    them for counsell or helpe in time of affliction.</i></p>

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_b.png" width="75" height="75" alt='B' /></span>
    UT whatsoever is reported or conceived of such maner of witchcrafts,
    I dare avow to be false and fabulous (coosinage, dotage, and poisoning
    excepted:) neither is there any mention made of these kind of witches
    in the Bible. If Christ had knowne them, he would not have pretermitted
    to invaie against their presumption, in taking upon them his office:
    as, to heale and cure diseases; and to worke such miraculous and
    supernaturall things, as whereby he himselfe was speciallie knowne,
    beleeved, and published to be God; his actions and cures consisting (in
    order and effect) according to the power by our witchmoongers imputed
    to witches. Howbeit, if there be any in these daies afflicted in such
    strange sort, as Christs cures and patients are described in the new
    testament to have beene: we flie from trusting in God to trusting in
    witches, who doo not onelie in their coosening art take on them the
    office of Christ in this behalfe; but use his verie phrase of speech
    to such idolaters, as com to seeke divine/<span class="snp" id="p_12"><i>12.</i></span> assistance at their hands,
    saieng; Go thy waies, thy sonne or thy daughter, &amp;c. shall doo well,
    and be whole.<span class="sni">John. 5: 6.<br />Mark. 5. 34.</span></p>

  <p>It will not suffice to dissuade a witchmonger from his credulitie,
    that he seeth the sequele and event to fall out manie times contrarie
    to their assertion; but in such case (to his greater condemnation)
    he seeketh further to witches of greater fame. If all faile, he will
    rather thinke he came an houre too late; than that he went a mile too
    far. Trulie I for my part cannot perceive what is to go a whoring <span class="sni">To go to witches, &amp;c. is idolatrie.</span>after
    strange gods, if this be not. He that looketh upon his neighbors wife,
    and lusteth after hir, hath committed adulterie. And truelie, he that
    in hart and by argument mainteineth the sacrifice of the masse to be
    propitiatorie for the quicke and the dead, is an idolater; as also he
    that alloweth and commendeth creeping to the crosse, and such like
    idolatrous actions, although he bend not his corporall knees.</p>

  <p>In like manner I say, he that attributeth to a witch, such divine
    power, as dulie and onelie apperteineth unto GOD (which all
    witchmongers doo) is in hart a blasphemer, an idolater, and full
    of grosse impietie, although he neither go nor send to hir for
    assistance./</p>

  <h3>The sixt Chapter.</h3>

  <p class="subhead"><i>A further confutation of witches miraculous and omnipotent
    power, by invincible reasons and authorities, with
    dissuasions from such fond credulitie.</i></p>

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_i.png" width="75" height="75" alt='I' /></span>F
    witches could doo anie such miraculous things, as these and other
    which are imputed to them, they might doo them againe and againe, at
    anie time or place, or at anie mans desire: for the divell is as strong
    at one time as at another, as busie by daie as by night, and readie
    enough to doo all mischeefe, and careth not whom he abuseth. And in so
    much as it is confessed, by the most part of witchmoongers themselves,
    that he knoweth not the cogitation of mans heart, he should (me thinks)
    sometimes appeere/<span class="snp" id="p_13"><i>13.</i></span> unto honest and credible persons, in such grosse
    and corporall forme, as it is said he dooth unto witches: which you
    shall never heare to be justified by one sufficient witnesse. For
    the divell indeed entreth into the mind, and that waie seeketh mans
    confusion.</p>

  <p>The art alwaies presupposeth the power; so as, if they saie they can
    doo this or that, they must shew how and by what meanes they doo it;
    as neither the witches, nor the witchmoongers are able to doo. For
    to everie action is required the facultie and abilitie of the agent
    or dooer; the aptnes of the patient or subject; and a convenient and
    possible application. Now the witches are mortall, and their power
    dependeth upon the analogie and consonancie of their minds and bodies;
    but with their minds they can but will and understand; and with their
    bodies they can doo no more, but as the bounds and ends of terrene
    sense will suffer: and therefore their power extendeth not to doo such
    miracles, as surmounteth their owne sense, and the understanding of
    others which are wiser than they; so as here wanteth the vertue and
    power of the efficient. And in reason, there can be no more vertue in
    the thing caused, than in the cause, or that which proceedeth of or
    from the benefit of the cause. And we see, that ignorant and impotent
    women, or witches, are the causes of incantations and charmes; wherein
    we shall perceive there is none effect, if we will credit our owne
    experience and sense unabused, the rules of philosophie, or the word of
    God.<span class="sni"><i>Aristot. de anima. lib. 2.</i><br />Acts. 8.</span>
    For alas! What an unapt instrument is a toothles, old, impotent,
    and unweldie woman to flie in the aier? Truelie, the divell little
    needs such instruments to bring his purposes to passe.</p>

  <p>It is strange, <span class="sni">Why shuld not the divell be as readie to helpe a
    theefe reallie as a witch?</span> that we should suppose, that such persons can worke
    such feates: and it is more strange, that we will imagine that to
    be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span> possible to be doone by a witch, which to nature and sense is
    impossible; speciallie when our neighbours life dependeth upon our
    credulitie therein; and when we may see the defect of abilitie, which
    alwaies is an impediment both to the act, and also to the presumption
    thereof. And bicause there is nothing possible in lawe,<span class="sni"><i>L. multum. l. si quis alteri, vel sibi.</i></span> that in nature
    is impossible; therefore the judge dooth not attend or regard what
    the accused man saith; or yet would/<span class="snp"><b>10.</b></span> doo: but what is prooved to have
    beene committed, and na/turallie<span class="snp" id="p_14"><i>14.</i></span> falleth in mans power and will to
    doo. For the lawe saith, that To will a thing unpossible, is a signe
    of a mad man, or of a foole, upon whom no sentence or judgement taketh
    hold. Furthermore, what Jurie will condemne, or what Judge will give
    sentence or judgement against one for killing a man at <i>Berwicke</i>; when
    they themselves, and manie other sawe that man at <i>London</i>, that verie
    daie, wherein the murther was committed; yea though the partie confesse
    himself guiltie therein, and twentie witnesses depose the same? But
    in this case also I saie the judge is not to weigh their testimonie,
    which is weakened by lawe; and the judges authoritie is to supplie the
    imperfection of the case, and to mainteine the right and equitie of the
    same.</p>

  <p>Seeing therefore that some other things might naturallie be the
    occasion and cause of such calamities as witches are supposed to
    bring; let not us that professe the Gospell and knowledge of Christ,
    be bewitched to beleeve that they doo such things, as are in nature
    impossible, and in sense and reason incredible.<span class="sni">An objection answered.</span> If they saie it is
    doone through the divels helpe, who can work miracles; whie doo not
    theeves bring their busines to passe miraculouslie, with whom the
    divell is as conversant as with the other? Such mischeefes as are
    imputed to witches, happen where no witches are; yea and continue when
    witches are hanged and burnt: whie then should we attribute such effect
    to that cause, which being taken awaie, happeneth neverthelesse?</p>

  <h3>The seventh Chapter.</h3>

  <p class="subhead"><i>By what meanes the name of witches becommeth so famous, and

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_s.png" width="75" height="75" alt='S' /></span>URELIE
    the naturall power of man or woman cannot be so inlarged, as
    to doo anie thing beyond the power and vertue given and ingraffed by
    God. But it is the will and mind of man, which is vitiated and depraved
    by the divell: neither dooth God permit anie more,<span class="sni">Miracles are ceased.</span> than that which
    the naturall order appointed by/<span class="snp" id="p_15"><i>15.</i></span> him dooth require. Which naturall
    order is nothing else, but the ordinarie power of God, powred into
    everie creature, according to his state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
    and condition. But hereof
    more shall be said in the title of witches confessions. Howbeit
    you shall understand, that few or none are throughlie persuaded,
    resolved, or satisfied, that witches can indeed accomplish all these
    impossibilities: but some one is bewitched in one point, and some is
    coosened in another, untill in fine, all these impossibilities, and
    manie mo, are by severall persons affirmed to be true.</p>

  <p>And this I have also noted,<span class="sni">The opinions of people concerning witchcraft are diverse and
    inconstant.</span> that when anie one is coosened with a
    coosening toie of witchcraft, and maketh report thereof accordinglie
    verifieng a matter most impossible and false as it were upon his owne
    knowledge, as being overtaken with some kind of illusion or other
    (which illusions are right inchantments) even the selfe-same man
    will deride the/snp like lie proceeding out of another mans mouth, as
    a fabulous matter unworthie of credit. It is also to be woondered,
    how men (that have seene some part of witches coosenages detected,
    and see also therein the impossibilitie of their owne presumptions,
    &amp; the follie and falsehood of the witches confessions) will not
    suspect, but remaine unsatisfied, or rather obstinatelie defend the
    residue of witches supernaturall actions: like as when a juggler hath
    discovered the slight and illusion of his principall feats, one would
    fondlie continue to thinke, that his other petie juggling knacks of
    legierdemaine are done by the helpe of a familiar: and according
    to the follie of some papists, who seeing and confessing the popes
    absurd religion, in the erection and maintenance of idolatrie and
    superstition, speciallie in images, pardons, and relikes of saints,
    will yet persevere to thinke, that the rest of his doctrine and
    trumperie is holie and good.</p>

  <p>Finallie, manie mainteine and crie out for the execution of witches,
    that particularlie beleeve never a whit of that which is imputed unto

    writeth,<span class="sni"><i>Card. de var. rerum. lib. 15. cap. 80.</i></span> that the cause of such credulitie consisteth in
    three points; to wit, in the imagination of the melancholike, in the
    constancie of them that are corrupt therewith, and in the deceipt of
    the Judges; who being inquisitors themselves against heretikes and
    witches, did both accuse and condemne them, having for their labour
    the spoile of their goods. So as these inquisitors added
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> manie fables
    hereunto, least they should seeme to have doone injurie to the poore
    wretches, in condemning and executing them for none offense. But
    sithens (saith he) the springing up of <i>Luthers</i> sect, these priests
    have tended more diligentlie upon the execution of them; bicause
    more wealth is to be caught from them: insomuch as now they deale so
    looselie with witches (through distrust of gaines) that all is seene to
    be malice, follie, or avarice that hath beene practised against them.
    And whosoever shall search into this cause, or read the cheefe writers
    hereupon, shall find his words true.</p>

  <p>It will be objected,<span class="sni">An objection answered.</span> that we here in <i>England</i> are not now directed
    by the popes lawes; and so by consequence our witches not troubled or
    convented by the inquisitors <i>Hæreticæ pravitatis</i>. I answer, that
    in times past here in <i>England</i>, as in other nations, this order of
    discipline hath beene in force and use; although now some part of
    old rigor be qualified by two severall statutes made in the fift
    of <i>Elizabeth</i>, and xxxiii of <i>Henrie</i> the eight. Nevertheles the
    estimation of the omnipotencie of their words and charmes seemeth
    in those statutes to be somewhat mainteined, as a matter hitherto
    generallie received; and not yet so looked into, as/<span class="snp"><b>12.</b></span> that it is
    refuted and decided. But how wiselie so ever the Parle/ment<span class="snp" id="p_17"><i>17.</i></span> house hath
    dealt therin, or how mercifullie soever the prince beholdeth the cause:
    if a poore old woman, supposed to be a witch, be by the civill or canon
    lawe convented; I doubt, some canon will be found in force, not onelie
    to give scope to the tormentor, but also to the hangman, to exercise
    their offices upon hir. And most certaine it is, that in what point
    soever anie of these extremities, which I shall rehearse unto you, be
    mitigated, it is thorough the goodnesse of the Queenes Majestie, and
    hir excellent magistrates placed among us. For as touching the opinion
    of our writers therein in our age; yea in our owne countrie, you shall
    see it doth not onlie agree with forren crueltie, but surmounteth it
    farre. If you read a foolish pamphlet dedicated to the lord <i>Darcy</i> by
    <i>W. W</i><span class="sni">W. W. his booke, printed in Anno Dom. 1582.</span>
    1582, you shall see that he affirmeth, that all those tortures
    are farre too light, and their rigor too mild; and that in that respect
    he impudentlie exclameth against our magistrates, who suffer them to
    be but hanged, when murtherers, &amp; such malefactors be so used, which
    deserve not the hundreth part of their punishments. But if you will see
    more follie and lewdnes comprised in one lewd booke, I commend you to
    <i>Ri. Ga.</i> a <i>Windsor</i> man; who being a mad man hath written according
    to his frantike humor: the reading wherof may satisfie a wise man, how
    mad all these witchmoongers dealings be in this behalfe.</p>

    suspected to be witches, after their apprehension may not be
    suffered to go home, or to other places, to seek suerties: for then
    (saith <i>Bodin</i>) the people would be woorse willing to accuse them;
    for feare least at their returne home, they worke revenge upon them.
    In which respect <i>Bodin</i> commendeth much the <i>Scottish</i> custome
    <span class="sni">The Scottish custōe of accusing a witch.</span> and
    order in this behalfe: where (he saith) a hollowe peece of wood
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> or a
    chest is placed in the church, into the which any bodie may freelie
    cast a little scroll of paper, wherein may be conteined the name of the
    witch, the time, place, and fact, &amp;c. And the same chest being locked
    with / three severall locks, is opened everie fifteenth daie by three
    inquisitors or officers appointed for that purpose; which keepe three
    severall kaies. And thus the accuser need not be knowne, nor shamed
    with the reproch of slander or malice to his poore neighbour.</p>

  <p>Item, there must be great persuasions used to all men, women, and
    children, to accuse old women of witchcraft.</p>

  <p>Item, there may alwaies be promised impunitie and favour to witches,
    that confesse and detect others; and for the contrarie, there may be
    threatnings and violence practised and used.</p>

  <p>Item, the little children of witches, which will not confesse, must
    be attached; who (if they be craftilie handled saith <i>Bodin</i>) will
    confesse against their owne mothers.</p>

  <p>Item, witches must be examined as suddenlie, and as unawares as is
    possible: the which will so amaze them, that they will confesse any
    thing, supposing the divell hath forsaken them; wheras if they should
    first be cōmitted to prison, the divell would tem/per<span class="snp" id="p_21"><i>21.</i></span> with them, and
    informe them what to doo.</p>

  <p>Item, the inquisitor, judge, or examiner, must begin with small matters first.</p>

  <p>Item, they must be examined, whether their parents were witches or no:
    for witches (as these Doctors suppose) come by propagation. And <i>Bodin</i>
    setteth downe this principle in witchcraft, to wit, <span class="sni"><i>I.
    Bod. lib. de dæmon. 4. cap. 4.<br />L. parentes de testibus.</i></span><i>Si saga sit mater,
    sic etiam est filia</i>: howbeit the lawe forbiddeth it, <i>Ob sanguinis
    reverentiam</i>.</p>

  <p>Item, the examiner must looke stedfastlie upon their eies: for they
    cannot looke directlie upon a mans face (as <i>Bodin</i> affirmeth in one
    place, although in another he saith, that they kill and destroie both
    men and beasts with their lookes.)</p>

  <p>Item, she must be examined of all accusations, presumptions, and
    faults, at one instant; least sathan should afterwards dissuade hir
    from confession.</p>

  <p>Item, a witch may not be put in prison alone, least the divell dissuade
    hir from confession, through promises of her indemnitie. For (saith
    <i>Bodin</i>) some that have beene in the gaole have prooved to flie awaie,
    as they were woont to doo when they met with <i>Diana</i> and <i>Minerva</i>,
    <i>&amp;c.</i>: and so brake their owne necks against the stone walles.</p>

  <p>Item, if anie denie hir owne confession made without torture, she
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span> is
    neverthelesse by that confession to be condemned, as in anie other
    crime.</p>

  <p>Item, the judges must seeme to put on a pittifull countenance and to
    mone them; saieng, that It was not they, but the divell that committed
    the murther, and that he compelled them to doo it; and must make them
    beleeve that they thinke them to be innocents.</p>

  <p>Item, if they will confesse nothing but upon the racke or torture;
    their apparell must be changed, and everie haire in their bodie must be
    shaven off with a sharpe razor.</p>

  <p>Item, if they have charmes for taciturnitie, so as they feele not the
    common tortures, and therefore confesse nothing: then some sharpe
    instrument must be thrust betwixt everie naile of their fingers and
    toes: which (as/<span class="snp"><b>15.</b></span> <i>Bodin</i>
    saith) was king <i>Childeberts</i> devise,<span class="sni">K. Childeberts cruell devise.</span> and is
    to this daie of all others the most effectuall. For by meanes of that
    extreme paine, they will (saith he) confesse anie/<span class="snp" id="p_22"><i>22.</i></span> thing.</p>

  <p>Item, <i>Paulus Grillandus</i>,<span class="sni"><i>P. Grillandus.</i></span>
    being an old dooer in these matters, wisheth
    that when witches sleepe, and feele no paine upon the torture, <i>Domine
    labia mea aperies</i> should be said, and so (saith he) both the torments
    will be felt, and the truth will be uttered: <i>Et sic ars deluditur
    arte</i>.</p>

  <p>Item,<span class="sni">A subtill and divelish devise.</span>
    <i>Bodin</i> saith, that at the time of examination, there should be a
    semblance of great a doo, to the terrifieing of the witch: and that a
    number of instruments, gieves, manacles, ropes, halters, fetters, &amp;c.
    be prepared, brought foorth, and laid before the examinate: and also
    that some be procured to make a most horrible and lamentable crie, in
    the place of torture, as though he or she were upon the racke, or in
    the tormentors hands: so as the examinate may heare it whiles she is
    examined, before she hir selfe be brought into the prison; and perhaps
    (saith he) she will by this meanes confesse the matter.</p>

  <p>Item, there must be subborned some craftie spie, that may seeme to be
    a prisoner with hir in the like case; who perhaps may in conference
    undermine hir, and so bewraie and discover hir.</p>

  <p>Item, if she will not yet confesse, she must be told that she is
    detected, and accused by other of hir companions; although in truth
    there be no such matter: and so perhaps she will confesse, the rather
    to be revenged upon hir adversaries and accusers.</p>

    an old woman threaten or touch one being in health, who dieth
    shortlie after; or else is infected with the leprosie, apoplexie, or
    anie other strange disease: it is (saith <i>Bodin</i>) a permanent fact, and
    such an evidence, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
    as condemnation or death must insue, without further
    proofe; if anie bodie have mistrusted hir, or said before that she was
    a witch./<span class="snp" id="p_23"><i>23.</i></span></p>

  <p>Item, if anie come in, or depart out of the chamber or house, the
    doores being shut; it is an apparent and sufficient evidence to a
    witches condemnation, without further triall: which thing <i>Bodin</i> never
    sawe. If he can shew me that feat, I will subscribe to his follie.
    For Christ after his resurrection used the same: not as a ridiculous
    toie, that everie witch might accomplish; but as a speciall miracle, to
    strengthen the faith of the elect.</p>

  <p>Item, if a woman bewitch anie bodies eies, she is to be executed
    without further proofe.</p>

  <p>Item, if anie inchant or bewitch mens beasts, or corne, or flie in the
    aire, or make a dog speake, or cut off anie mans members, and unite
    them againe to men or childrens bodies; it is sufficient proofe to
    condemnation.</p>

  <p>Item, presumptions and conjectures are sufficient proofes against
    witches./<span class="snp"><b>16.</b></span></p>

  <p>Item,<span class="sni"><i>Bar. Spineus, &amp;, I. Bod. de dæmon. lib. 2. cap. 2.</i></span> if three witnesses doo but saie, Such a woman is a witch; then is
    it a cleere case that she is to be executed with death. Which matter
    <i>Bodin</i> saith is not onelie certeine by the canon and civill lawes, but
    by the opinion of pope <i>Innocent</i>, the wisest pope (as he saith) that
    ever was.</p>

  <p>Item,<span class="sni"><i>Alexander. L. ubi numerus de testibus.<br />I. Bod. de dæmon.
    lib. 2. cap. 2.</i></span> the complaint of anie one man of credit is sufficient to bring a
    poore woman to the racke or pullie.</p>

  <p>Item, a condemned or infamous persons testimonie is good and allowable
    in matters of witchcraft.</p>

  <p>Item, a witch is not to be delivered, though she endure all the
    tortures, and confesse nothing; as all other are in anie criminall
    cases.</p>

  <p>Item, though in other cases the depositions of manie women at one
    instant are disabled, as insufficient in lawe; bicause of the
    imbecillitie and frailtie of their nature or sex: yet in this matter,
    one woman, though she be a partie, either accuser or accused, and
    be also infamous and impudent (for such are <i>Bodins</i> words) yea and
    alreadie condemned; she may neverthelesse serve to accuse and condemne
    a witch.</p>

  <p>Item, a witnesse uncited, and offering himselfe in this case is to be
    heard, and in none other.</p>

  <p>Item, a capitall enimie (if the enimitie be pretended to growe by
    meanes of witchcraft) may object against a witch; and none/<span class="snp" id="p_24"><i>24.</i></span> exception
    is to be had or made against him.</p>

  <p>Item, the proctors and advocats in this case are compelled to be
    witnesses against their clients, as in none other case they are to be
    constrained there unto.</p>

  <p>Item, none can give evidence against witches, touching their
    assemblies, but witches onelie: bicause (as <i>Bodin</i><span class="sni">In

    can doo it. Howbeit, <i>Ri. Ga.</i> writeth, that he came to the God speed,
    and with his sword and buckler killed the divell; or at the least he
    wounded him so sore, that he made him stinke of brimstone.</p>

    to hagging, and how she behaved hir selfe. Whereupon was much a doo
    among the inquisitors and lawyers, to discusse whether he should be
    executed with his wife or no. But it was concluded that he must die,
    bicause he bewraied not his wife: the which he forbare to doo, <i>Propter
      reverentiam honoris &amp; familiæ</i>.</p>

  <p>Item, if a woman confesse freelie herein, before question be made; and
    yet afterward denie it: she is neverthelesse to be burned.</p>

  <p>Item, they affirme that this extremitie is herein used, bicause not

  <p>Item, though a conjurer be not to be condemned for curing the diseased
    by vertue of his art: yet must a witch die for the like case.</p>

  <p>Item, the behaviour, looks, becks, and countenance of a woman, are
    sufficient signes, whereby to presume she is a witch: for alwais they
    looke downe to the ground, and dare not looke a man full in the face.</p>

  <p>Item, if their parents were thought to be witches, then is it
    certeinlie to be presumed that they are so: but it is not so to be
    thought of whoores.</p>

  <p>Item, it is a vehement presumption if she cannot weepe, at the

    drops out of hir right eie.</p>

    evident proofe of a witch, if any man or beast die suddenlie where she
    hath beene seene latelie; although hir witching stuffe be not found or
    espied.</p>

    it is a sufficient presumption against that person to be adjudged a
    witch./<span class="snp" id="p_27"><i>27.</i></span></p>

  <p>Item, herein judgment must be pronounced &amp; executed (as <i>Bodin</i> saith)
    without order, and not like to the orderlie proceeding and forme of
    judgement in other crimes.</p>

  <p>Item, a witch may not be brought to the torture suddenlie, or before
    long examination, least she go awaie scotfree: for they feele no
    torments, and therefore care not for the same (as <i>Bodin</i> affirmeth.)</p>

  <p>Item,<span class="sni"><i>Idem Ibid.</i></span> little children may be had to the torture at the first dash; but

    haire, under hir lip, or in hir buttocke, or in hir privities: it is a
    presumption sufficient for the judge to proceed and give sentence of
    death upon hir.</p>

  <p>The onlie pitie they shew to a poore woman in this case, is; that
    though she be accused to have slaine anie bodie with her inchantments;
    yet if she can bring foorth the partie alive, she shall not be put to

    &nbsp;NEEDE not staie to confute such parciall and horrible dealings, being
    so apparentlie impious, and full of tyrannie which except I should have
    so manifestlie detected, even with their owne writings and assertions,
    few or none would have beleeved. But for brevities sake I will passe
    over the same; supposing that the ci/ting<span class="snp" id="p_28"><i>28.</i></span> of such absurdities may stand
    for a suffici/ent<span class="snp"><b>19.</b></span> confutation thereof. Now therefore I will proceed
    to a more particular order and maner of examinations, &amp;c: used by the
    inquisitors, and allowed for the most part throughout all nations.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

  <p>First the witch must be demanded,<span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef. super, interrog.</i></span> why she touched such a child, or such
    a cow, &amp;c: and afterward the same child or cow fell sicke or lame, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Item, why hir two kine give more milke than hir neighbors. And the
    note before mentioned is heere againe set downe, to be speciallie
    observed of all men: to wit; that Though a witch cannot weepe, yet she
    may speake with a crieng voice. Which asserti<span class="sni"><i>Seneca
    in tragœd.<br />Mal. malef. part. 3. quæst 15. act. 10.</i></span>on of weeping is false,
    and contrarie to the saieng of <i>Seneca</i>, <i>Cato</i>, and manie others;
    which affirme, that A woman weepeth when she meaneth most deceipt: and
    therefore saith <i>M. Mal.</i> she must be well looked unto, otherwise she
    will put spettle privilie upon hir cheeks, and seeme to weepe: which
    rule also <i>Bodin</i> saith is infallible. But alas that teares should be
    thought sufficient to excuse or condemne in so great a cause, and so
    weightie a triall! I am sure that the woorst sort of the children of
    Israel wept bitterlie: yea, if there were any witches at all in Israel,
    they wept. For it is written,<span class="sni">Num. 11, 4.<br />1. Sam. 11, 4.<br />2. Sa. 15, 23.<br />Mat. 8. &amp; 13. &amp;
    22. &amp; 24. &amp; 25.<br />Luke 3. &amp;c.</span> that all the children of Israel wept.
    Finallie, if there be any witches in hell, I am sure they weepe: for
    there is weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth.</p>

  <p>But God knoweth, many an honest matrone cannot sometimes in the
    heavines of her heart shed teares; the which oftentimes are more readie
    and common with craftie queanes and strumpets, than with sober women.
    For we read of two kinds of teares in a womans eie, the one of true
    greefe, the other of deceipt. And it is written, that <i>Dediscere flere
      fæminam est mendacium</i>:<span class="sni"><i>Seneca in tragœd.</i></span>
    which argueth, that they lie which say, that
    wicked women cannot weepe. But let these tormentors take heed, that
    the teares in this case which runne downe the widowes cheeks, with
    their crie spoken of<span class="sni">Eccl. 35, 15.</span> by Jesus Sirach, be not heard above. But lo what
    learned, godlie, and lawfull meanes these popish inquisitors have
    invented for the triall of true or false teares./</p>

  <p class="subhead"><i>Certaine cautions against witches, and of their tortures to
    procure confession.</i></p>

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_b.png" width="75" height="75" alt='B' /></span>UT
    to manifest their further follies, I will recite some of their
    cautions, which are published by the ancient inquisitors, for
    perpetuall lessons to their successors: as followeth.</p>

  <p>The first caution is that, which was last rehearsed concerning weeping;
    the which (say they) is an infallible note.</p>

  <p>Secondlie, the judge must beware she touch no part of him, speciallie
    of his bare; and that he alwaies weare about his necke conjured salt,
    palme, herbes, and waxe halowed: which (say they)<span class="sni"><i>Ja. Sprenger.<br />H. Institor.</i></span> are not onelie
    approoved to be good by the witches confessions; but/<span class="snp" id="p_30"><i>30.</i></span> also by the use
    of the Romish church, which halloweth them onelie for that purpose.</p>

  <p>Item,<span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef. pa. 3, quæ. 15.</i></span>
    she must come to hir arreignement backward, to wit, with hir
    taile to the judges face, who must make manie crosses, at the time of
    hir approching to the barre. And least we should condemne that for
    superstition, they prevent us with a figure,<span class="sni"><i>Prolepsis
    or Præoccupation.</i></span> and tell us, that the same
    superstition may not seeme superstitious unto us. But this resembleth
    the persuasion of a theefe, that dissuadeth his sonne from stealing;
    and neverthelesse telleth him that he may picke or cut a pursse, and
    rob by the high waie.</p>

  <p>One other caution is, that she must be shaven, so as there remaine not
    one haire about hir: for sometimes they keepe secrets for taciturnitie,
    and for other purposes also in their haire, in their privities, and
    betweene their skinne and their flesh. For which cause I marvell they
    flea them not: for one of their witches would not burne, being in the
    middest of the flame, as <i>M. Mal.</i><span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef.</i></span>
    reporteth; untill a charme written
    in a little scroll was espied to be hidden betweene hir skin and flesh,
    and taken awaie. And this is so gravelie and faithfullie set downe by
    the inquisitors themselves, that one may beleeve it if he list, though
    indeed it be a verie lie. The like lie citeth <i>Bodin</i>,<span class="sni"><i>John. Bod.</i></span> of a witch that
    could not be strangled by the executioner, doo what he could. But it is
    most true, that the inquisitor <i>Cumanus</i><span class="sni">Anno. 1485 a knave inquisitor.</span> in one yeare did shave one and
    fourtie poore women, and burnt them all when he had done.</p>

  <p>Another caution<span class="sni"><i>Q. 16. de tempore &amp; modo interrog.</i></span> is, that at the time and place of torture, the hallowed
    things aforesaid, with the seaven words spoken on the crosse, be
    hanged about the witches necke; and the length of Christ in waxe be
    knit about hir bare naked bodie, with relikes of saints, &amp;c. All which
    stuffe (saie they) will so worke within and upon them, as when they
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
    are racked and tortured, they can hardlie staie or hold themselves from
    confession. In which case I doubt not but that pope,<span class="sni">Blasphemous
    pope Julie, of that name the third.</span> which blasphemed
    Christ, and curssed his mother for a pecocke, and curssed God with
    great despights for a peece of porke, with lesse compulsion would have
    renounced the trinitie, and have worshipped the divell upon his knees./<span class="snp"><b>1.</b></span></p>

  <p>Another caution is, that after she hath beene racked, and hath passed
    over all tortures devised for that purpose; and after that she hath
    beene compelled to drinke holie water, she be conveied/<span class="snp" id="p_31"><i>31.</i></span> againe to
    the place of torture: and that in the middest of hir torments, hir
    accusations be read unto hir; and that the witnesses (if they will) be
    brought face to face unto hir: and finallie, that she be asked, whether
    for triall of hir innocencie she will have judgement, <i>Candentis
    ferri</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef. par. 3. quæ. 16.</i></span>
    which is; To carrie a certeine weight of burning iron in hir
    bare hand. But that may not (saie they) in anie wise be granted. For
    both <i>M. Mal.</i> and <i>Bodin</i> also affirme, that manie things may be
    promised, but nothing need be performed: for whie, they have authoritie
    to promise, but no commission to performe the same.</p>

  <p>Another caution is, that the judge take heed, that when she once
    beginneth to confesse, he cut not off hir examination, but continue it
    night and daie. For many-times, whiles they go to dinner, she returneth
    to hir vomit.</p>

  <p>Another caution is, that after the witch hath confessed the annoieing
    of men and beasts, she be asked how long she hath had <i>Incubus</i>, when
    she renounced the faith, and made the reall league, and what that
    league is, &amp;c. And this is indeede the cheefe cause of all their
    incredible and impossible confessions: for upon the racke, when they
    have once begunne to lie, they will saie what the tormentor list.</p>

  <p>The last caution is, that if she will not confesse, she be had to some
    strong castle or gaole. And after certeine daies, the gaolor must make
    hir beleeve he goeth foorth into some farre countrie: and then some
    of hir freends must come in to hir, and promise hir, that if she will
    confesse to them, they will suffer hir to escape out of prison: which
    they may well doo, the keeper being from home. And this waie (saith <i>M.
    Mal.</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef. par. 3. quæ. 16. act. 11.</i></span>
    hath served, when all other meanes have failed.</p>

  <p>And in this place it may not be omitted, that above all other times,
    they confesse upon fridaies. Now saith <i>James Sprenger</i>, and <i>Henrie
      Institor</i>, we must saie all, to wit: If she confesse nothing, she
    should be dismissed by lawe; and yet by order she may in no wise be
    bailed, but must be put into close prison, and there be talked withall
    by some craftie person (those are the words) and in the meane while
    there must be some eves-dropers with pen and inke behind the wall,
    to hearken and note what she confesseth: or else some of hir old
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
    companions and acquain/tance<span class="snp" id="p_32"><i>32.</i></span> may come in and talke with hir of old
    matters, and so by eves-droppers be also bewraied; so as there shall be
    no end of torture before she have confessed what they will./<span class="snp"><b>2.</b></span></p>

    more ridiculous or abhominable crimes could have beene invented,
    these poore women (whose cheefe fault is that they are scolds) should
    have beene charged with them.</p>

  <p>In this libell you dooe see is conteined all that witches are charged
    with; and all that also, which anie witchmoonger surmiseth, or in
    malice imputeth unto witches power and practise.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

  <p>Some of these crimes may not onelie be in the power and will of a
    witch, but may be accomplished by naturall meanes: and therefore by
    them the matter in question is not decided, to wit; Whether<span class="sni">The
    question or matter in controversie: that is to say, the
    proposition or theme.</span> a witch can
    worke woonders supernaturallie? For manie a knave and whore dooth more
    commonlie put in execution those lewd actions, than such as are called
    witches, and are hanged for their labour.</p>

  <p>Some of these crimes also laid unto witches charge, are by me denied,
    and by them cannot be prooved to be true, or committed by any one
    witch. Othersome of these crimes likewise are so absurd, supernaturall,
    and impossible, that they are derided almost of all men, and as
    false, fond, and fabulous reports condemned: insomuch as the very
    witchmoongers themselves are ashamed to heare of them.</p>

  <p>If part be untrue, why may not the residue be thought false? For all
    these things are laid to their charge at one instant, even by the
    greatest doctors and patrones of the sect of witchmongers, producing as
    manie proofs for witches supernaturall and impossible actions, as for
    the other. So as, if one part of their accusation be false, the other
    part deserveth no credit. If all be true that is alledged of their
    dooings, why should we beleeve in Christ, bicause of his miracles, when
    a witch dooth as great/<span class="snp" id="p_35"><b>24.</b> <i>35.</i></span> wonders as/ ever he did?</p>

  <p>But it will be said by some; As for those absurd and popish writers,
    they are not in all their allegations, touching these matters,
    to be credited.<span class="sni">A generall error.</span> But I assure you, that even all sorts of writers
    heerein (for the most part) the very doctors of the church to the
    schoolemen, protestants and papists, learned and unlearned, poets
    and historiographers, Jewes, Christians, or Gentiles agree in these
    impossible and ridiculous matters. Yea and these writers, out of whome
    I gather most absurdities, are of the best credit and authoritie of all
    writers in this matter. The reason is, bicause it was never throughlie
    looked into; but everie fable credited; and the word (Witch) named so
    often in scripture.</p>

  <p class="subhead"><i>The opinion of Cornelius Agrippa concerning witches, of his
    pleading for a poore woman accused of witchcraft, and how he
    convinced the inquisitors.</i></p>

    AGRIPPA</i> saith, that while he was in <i>Italie</i>, manie
    inquisitors in the dutchie of <i>Millen</i> troubled divers most honest &amp;
    noble matrones, privilie wringing much monie from them, untill their
    knaverie was detected. Further he saith, that being an advocate or
    councellor in the Commonwelth of <i>Maestright</i> in <i>Brabant</i>, he had sore
    contention with an inquisitor, who through un/just<span class="snp" id="p_36"><i>36.</i></span> accusations drew a
    poore woman of the countrie into his butcherie, and to an unfit place;
    not so much to examine hir, as to torment hir. Whom when <i>C. Agrippa</i>
    had undertaken to defend, declaring that in the things doone, there
    was no proofe, no signe or token that could cause hir to be tormented;
    the inquisitor stoutlie denieng it, said; One thing there is, which is
    proofe and matter sufficient: for hir mother was in times past burned
    for a witch. Now when <i>Agrippa</i> replied, affirming that this article
    was impertinent, and ought to be refused by the judge, as being the
    deed of another; alledging to the inquisitor, reasons and lawe for
    the same: he replied againe that this was true, bicause they used to
    sacrifice their children to the divell, as soone as they were borne;
    and also bicause they usuallie conceived by spirits transformed into
    mans shape, and that thereby witchcraft was naturallie ingraffed into
    this child, as a disease that commeth by inheritance./<span class="snp"><b>33.</b></span></p>

  <p><i>C. Agrippa</i> replieng<span class="sni">A bitter invective against
    a cruell inquisitor.</span> against the inquisitors follie &amp; superstitious
    blindnesse, said; O thou wicked preest! Is this thy divinitie? Doost
    thou use to drawe poore guiltlesse women to the racke by these forged
    devises? Doost thou with such sentences judge others to be heretikes,
    thou being a more heretike than either <i>Faustus</i> or <i>Donatus</i>? Be it
    as thou saiest, dooest thou not frustrate the grace of Gods ordinance;
    namelie baptisme? Are the words in baptisme spoken in vaine? Or shall
    the divell remaine in the child, or it in the power of the divell,
    being there and then consecrated to Christ Jesus, in the name of the
    father, the sonne, and the holie ghost? And if thou defend their false
    opinions, which affirm, that spirits accompanieng with women, can
    ingender; yet dotest thou more than anie of them, which never beleeved
    that anie of those divels, togither with their stolne seed, doo put
    part of that their seed or nature into the creature. But though indeed
    we be borne the children of the divell and damnation, yet in baptisme,
    through grace in Christ, sathan is cast out, and we are
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> made new
    creatures in the Lord, from whome none can be separated by another mans
    deed. The inquisitor being hereat offended, threatened the advocate
    to proceed against him, as a supporter of heretikes or witches; yet
    neverthelesse he ceased not to defend the seelie woman, and through the
    power of the lawe he delivered hir/<span class="snp" id="p_37"><i>37.</i></span> from the clawes of the bloodie
    moonke, who with hir accusers, were condemned in a great summe of monie
    to the charter of the church of <i>Mentz</i>, and remained infamous after
    that time almost to all men.</p>

  <p>But by the waie you must understand, that this was but a petie
    inquisitor, and had not so large a commission as <i>Cumanus</i>, <i>Sprenger</i>,
    and such other had; nor yet as the <i>Spanish</i> inquisitors at this daie
    have. For these will admit no advocats now unto the poore soules,
    except the tormentor or hangman may be called an advocate. You may read
    the summe of this inquisition in few words set out by M. <i>John Fox</i>
    <span class="sni">John Fox in the acts and monuments.</span>
    in the Acts and monuments. For witches and heretikes are among the
    inquisitors of like reputation; saving that the extremitie is greater
    against witches, bicause through their simplicitie, they may the more
    boldlie tyrannize upon them, and triumph over them.</p>

    flesh and bloud is unable to endure such triall? Or how can she in the

    as these poore witches are, which be not examined by girles, but by
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
    cunning inquisitors, who having the spoile of their goods, and bringing
    with them into the place of judgement minds to maintaine their bloudie
    purpose, spare no maner of allurements, thretenings, nor torments,
    untill they have wroong out of them all that, which either maketh to
    their owne desire, or serveth to the others destruction.</p>

  <p><i>Peter</i> (I saie) in the presence of his Lord and maister Christ, who
    had instructed him in true knowledge manie yeares, being forewarned,
    not passing foure or five houres before, and having made a reall
    league and a faithfull promise to the contrarie, without anie other
    compulsion than (as hath beene said) by a question proposed by a girle,
    against his conscience, forsooke, thrise denied, and abandoned his
    said maister: and yet he was a man illuminated, and placed in dignitie
    aloft, and neerer to Christ by manie degrees, than the witch, whose
    fall could not be so great as <i>Peters</i>; bicause she never ascended
    halfe so manie steps. A pastors declination is much more abhominable
    that the going astraie of anie of his sheepe: as an ambassadors
    conspiracie is more odious than the falshood of a common person: or
    as a capteins treason is more mischeevous than a private soldiers
    mutinie. If you saie, <i>Peter</i> repented; I answer that the witch dooth
    so likewise sometimes, and I see not in that case, but mercie may be
    emploied upon hir. It were a mightie temptation to a seelie old woman,
    that a visible divell (being in shape so ugglie, as <i>Danæus</i><span class="sni"><i>Danæus in dialog.</i></span> and others
    saie he is) should assalt hir in maner and forme as is supposed, or
    rather avowed; speciallie when there is promise made that none shall
    be tempted above their strength.<span class="sni">1 Cor. 10.</span> The poore old witch is commonlie
    unlearned, unwarned, and unprovided of counsell and freendship, void of
    judgement and discretion to moderate hir life and communication, hir
    kind and gender more weake and fraile than the masculine, and much more
    subject to melancholie; hir bringing up and companie is so base, that
    nothing is to be/<span class="snp" id="p_39"><i>39.</i></span> looked for in hir speciallie of these extraordinarie
    qualities; hir age also is commonlie such, as maketh her decrepite,
    which is a disease that mooveth them to these follies.</p>

  <p>Finallie, Christ did cleerelie remit <i>Peter</i>, though his offense were
    committed both against his divine and humane person: yea afterwards he
    did put him in trust to feed his sheepe, and shewed great countenance,
    freendship and love unto him. And there-
    fore I see not, but we may shew compassion upon
    these poore soules; if they shew themselves

    which in this matter of witchcraft hath abused so manie, and
    seemeth both so horrible and intollerable, is a plaine bargaine,
    that (they saie) is made betwixt the divell and the witch. And manie
    of great learning conceive it to be a matter of truth, and in their
    writings publish it accordinglie: the which (by Gods grace) shall be
    prooved as vaine and false as the rest.</p>

  <p>The order of their bargaine<span class="sni">The double bargane of witches
    with the divell.</span> or profession is double; the one solemne
    and publike; the other secret and private. That which is called solemne
    or publike, is where witches come togither at certeine assemblies, at
    the times prefixed, and doo not onelie see the divell in visible forme;
    but confer and talke familiarlie with him. In which conference the
    divell exhorteth them to observe their fidelitie unto him, promising
    them long life and prosperitie. Then the witches assembled, commend a
    new disciple (whom they call a novice) unto him: and if the divell find
    that yoong witch apt and forward in renunciation of christian faith,
    in despising anie of the seven sacraments, in treading upon crosses,
    in spetting at the time of the elevation, in breaking their fast on
    fasting daies, and fasting on sundaies; then the divell giveth
    foorth/<span class="snp" id="p_41"><i>41.</i></span> his hand, and the novice joining hand in hand with him, promiseth to
    observe and keepe all the divels commandements.</p>

  <p>This done, the divell beginneth to be more bold with hir, telling
    hir plainlie, that all this will not serve his turne; and therefore
    requireth homage at hir hands:<span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef. de modo
    professionis.</i></span> yea he also telleth hir, that she must
    grant him both hir bodie and soule to be tormented in everlasting
    fire: which she yeeldeth unto. Then he chargeth hir, to procure as
    manie men, women, and children also, as she can, to enter into this
    societie. Then he teacheth them to make ointments of the bowels and
    members of children, whereby they ride in the aire, and accomplish all
    their desires. So as, if there be anie children unbaptised, or not
    garded with the signe of the crosse, or orizons; then the witches may
    and doo catch them from their mothers sides in the night, or out of
    their cradles, or otherwise kill them with their
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> ceremonies; and after
    buriall steale them out of their graves, and seeth them in a caldron,
    untill their flesh be made potable. Of the thickest whereof they make
    ointments, whereby they ride in the aire; but the thinner potion they
    put into flaggons, whereof whosoever drinketh, observing certeine
    ceremonies, immediatlie becommeth a maister or rather a mistresse in

    their homage<span class="sni">Homage of witches to the divell.</span> with their oth and bargaine is received for a
    certeine terme of yeares; sometimes for ever. Sometimes it consisteth
    in the deniall of the whole faith, sometimes in part. The first is,
    when the soule is absolutelie yeelded to the divell and hell fier: the
    other is, when they have but bargained [not] to/<span class="snp" id="p_42"><i>42.</i></span> observe certeine
    ceremonies and statutes of the church; as to conceale faults at shrift,
    to fast on sundaies, &amp;c. And this is doone either by oth, protestation
    of words, or by obligation in writing, sometimes sealed with wax,
    sometimes signed with bloud, sometimes by kissing the divels bare
    buttocks; as did a Doctor called <i>Edlin</i>, who as (<i>Bodin</i> saith) was
    burned for witchcraft.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Bar. Spineus, cap. 1. in novo Mal. malef.</i></span>
    You must also understand, that after they have delicatlie banketted
    with the divell and the ladie of the fairies; and have eaten up a fat
    oxe, and emptied a butt of malmesie, and a binne of bread at some
    noble mans house, in the dead of the night, nothing is missed of all
    this in the morning. For the ladie <i>Sibylla</i>, <i>Minerva</i>, or <i>Diana</i>
    with a golden rod striketh the vessell &amp; the binne, and they are
    fullie replenished againe. Yea, she causeth the bullocks bones to be
    brought and laid togither upon the hide, and lappeth the foure ends
    thereof togither, laieng her golden rod thereon; and then riseth up the
    bullocke againe in his former estate and condition: and yet at their
    returne home they are like to starve for hunger; as <i>Spineus</i><span class="sni"><i>Idem Ibid.</i></span> saith.
    And this must be an infallible rule, that everie fortnight, or at the
    least everie moneth, each witch must kill one child at the least for
    hir part.</p>

  <p>And here some of <i>Monsieur Bodins</i><span class="sni"><i>I. Bod.
    de dæmon. lib. 2, cap. 4.</i></span> lies may be inserted, who saith that
    at these magicall assemblies, the witches never faile to danse; and
    in their danse they sing these words; Har har, divell divell, danse
    here, danse here, plaie here, plaie here, <i>Sabbath</i>, <i>sabbath</i>. And
    whiles they sing and danse, everie one hath a broome in hir hand,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> and
    holdeth it up aloft. Item he saith, that these night-walking or rather
    night-dansing witches, brought out of <i>Italie</i> into <i>France</i>, that
    danse, which is called <i>La volta</i>.</p>

  <p>A part of their league is, to scrape off the oile,<span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef.</i></span> which is received
    in extreame follie (unction I should have said). But if that be so
    dangerous, they which socke the corps had neede to take great care,
    that they rub not off the oile, which divers other waies may also be
    thrust out of the forehead; and then I perceive all the vertue thereof
    is gone, and farewell it. But I marvell how they take on to preserve
    the water powred on them in baptisme, which I take to be largelie of
    as great force as the other; and yet I thinke is commonlie wiped and
    washed off, within foure and twentie houres/<span class="snp" id="p_43"><b>37.</b> <i>43.</i></span> after baptisme: but this
    agreeth with the residue/ of their follie.</p>

  <p>And this is to be noted, that the inquisitors affirme, that during the
    whole time of the witches excourse, the divell occupieth the roome and
    place of the witch, in so perfect a similitude, as hir husband in his
    bed, neither by feeling, speech, nor countenance can discerne hir from
    his wife. Yea the wife departeth out of her husbands armes insensiblie,
    and leaveth the divell in hir roome visiblie. Wherein their
    incredulitie is incredible, who will have a verie bodie in the feined
    plaie, and a phantasticall bodie in the true bed: and yet (forsooth)
    at the name of Jesus, or at the signe of the crosse,<span class="sni"><i>Grillandus.

    the night, that he may understand whom they have slaine, and how they
    have profited. If they be lame, he saith the divell delivereth them
    a staffe, to conveie them thither invisiblie through the aire; and
    that then they fall a dansing and singing of bawdie songs, wherein he
    leadeth the danse himselfe. Which danse, and other conferencies being
    ended, he supplieth their wants of powders and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> roots to intoxicate
    withall; and giveth to everie novice a marke, either with his teeth
    or with his clawes, and so they kisse the divels bare buttocks, and
    depart:/<span class="snp" id="p_44"><i>44.</i></span> not forgetting every daie afterwards to offer to him, dogs,
    cats, hens, or bloud of their owne.<span class="sni"><i>Ide. Ibidem.</i></span> And all this dooth <i>Danæus</i> report
    as a troth, and as it were upon his owne knowledge. And yet else-where
    <span class="sni"><i>Idem. in dialog. cap. 3.</i></span>
    he saieth; In these matters they doo but dreame, and doo not those
    things indeed, which they confesse through their distemperature,
    growing of their melancholike humor: and therefore (saith he) these
    things, which they report of themselves, are but meere illusions.</p>

  <p><i>Psellus</i> addeth hereunto, that certeine magicall heretikes, to wit;
    the <i>Eutychians</i>, assemblie themselves everie good fridaie at night;
    and putting out the candles, doo commit incestuous adulterie, the
    father with the daughter, the sister with the brother, and the sonne
    with the mother; and the ninth moneth they returne and are delivered;
    and cutting their children in peeces, fill their pots with their bloud;
    then burne they the carcases,<span class="sni"><i>Card. lib. de var. rerum. 15. cap. 80.</i></span>
    and mingle the ashes therewith, and so
    preserve the same for magicall purposes. <i>Cardanus</i> writeth (though in
    mine opinion not verie/<span class="snp"><b>38.</b></span> probablie) that these excourses, dansings,
    &amp;c: had their beginning from certeine heretikes called <i>Dulcini</i>, who
    devised those feasts of <i>Bacchus</i> which are named <i>Orgia</i>, whereunto
    these kind of people openlie assembled; and beginning with riot, ended
    with this follie. Which feasts being prohibited, they nevertheles
    hanted them secretlie; and when they could not doo so, then did they it
    in cogitation onelie, and even to this daie (saith he) there remaineth
    a certeine image or resemblance thereof among our melancholike women.</p>

    and I will beleeve him. But by what authoritie, proofe, or testimonie;
    and upon what ground all this geere standeth, if you read <i>M. Mal.</i>
    <span class="sni"><i>Mal. Malef. par. 2. quæ. 7. cap. 2.</i></span>

    their tales, and are at such contrarietie:) and to the reproch of the
    beleevers of such absurd lies.</p>

  <p>For the beginning of the credit hereof,<span class="sni">Upon what ground
    this real league began to growe in credit.</span> resteth upon the confession of
    a baggage yoong fellow condemned to be burnt for witchcraft; who said
    to the inquisitors, of likelihood to prolong his life, (if at leastwise
    the storie be true, which is taken out of <i>Nider</i>;) If I wist (quoth
    he) that I might obteine pardon, I would discover all that I knowe of
    witchcraft. The which condition being accepted, and pardon promised
    (partlie in hope thereof, and partlie to be rid of his wife) he said as
    followeth.</p>

  <p>The novice or yoong disciple goeth to some church, togither with
    the mistresse of that profession, upon a sundaie morning, before
    the conjuration of holie water, &amp; there the said novice renounceth
    the faith, promiseth obedience in observing, or rather omitting of
    ceremonies in meetings, and such other follies; and finallie, that they
    doo homage to their yoong maister the divell, as they covenanted.</p>

  <p>But this is notable in that storie, that this yoong witch, doubting
    that his wives examination would bewraie his knaverie, told the

    maner of their private league<span class="sni">The maner of witches
    private league with the divell.</span> is said to be, when the divell
    invisible, and sometimes visible, in the middest of the people talketh
    with them privatelie; promising, that if they will followe his
    counsell, he will supplie all their necessities, and make all their
    endevors prosperous: and so beginneth with small matters: whereunto
    they consent privilie, and come not into the fairies assemblie.</p>

  <p>And in this case (mee thinks) the divell sometimes, in such externall
    or corporall shape, should meete with some that would not consent to
    his motions (except you will saie he knoweth their cogitations) and
    so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
    should be bewraied. They also (except they were idiots) would spie
    him, and forsake him for breach of covenants. But these bargaines, and
    these assemblies doo all the writers hereupon mainteine: and <i>Bodin</i>
    confirmeth them with a hundred and odd lies; among the number whereof I
    will (for diverse causes) recite one.</p>

  <p>There was (saith he)<span class="sni"><i>J. Bod. lib. 2. de dæmonomania.
    cap. 4.</i></span> a noble Gentlewoman at <i>Lions</i>, that being in bed
    with a lover of hirs, suddenlie in the night arose up, and lighted a
    candle: which when she had done, she tooke a box of ointment, wherewith
    she annointed her bodie; and after a few words spoken, she was carried
    awaie. Hir bedfellow seeing the order hereof, lept out of his bed,
    tooke the candle in his hand, and sought for the ladie round about the
    chamber, and in everie corner thereof. But though he could not find
    hir, yet did he find hir box of ointment: and being desirous to know
    the vertue thereof, besmeered himselfe therewith, even as he perceived
    hir to have done before.<span class="sni">This agreeth not with their interpretation, that saie, this
    is onlie done by vertue of the legue; nor yet to them that referre it
    unto words: quoth nota.</span> And although he were not so superstitious,
    as to use anie words to helpe him forward in his busines, yet by the
    vertue of that ointment (saith <i>Bodin</i>) he was immediatlie conveied/<span class="snp" id="p_47"><i>47.</i></span>
    to <i>Lorreine</i>, into the assemblie of witches. Which when he sawe, he
    was abashed, and said; In the name of God, what make I heere? And upon
    those words the whole assemblie vanished awaie, and left him there
    alone starke naked; and so was he faine to returne to <i>Lions</i>. But he
    had so good a conscience (for you may perceive by the first part of the
    historie, he was a verie honest man) that he accused his true lover for
    a witch, and caused hir to be burned. But as for his adulterie, neither
    <i>M. Mal.</i> nor <i>Bodin</i> doo once so much as speake in the dispraise
    thereof.</p>

  <p>It appeareth throughout all <i>Bodins</i> booke, that he is sore offended
    with <i>Cornelius Agrippa</i>, and the rather (as I suppose) bicause the
    said <i>C. Agrippa</i> recanted that which <i>Bodin</i> mainteineth, who thinketh
    he could worke wonders by magicke, and speciallie by his blacke dog.
    It should seeme he/<span class="snp"><b>40.</b></span> had prettie skill in the art of divination. For
    though he wrote before <i>Bodin</i> manie a yeare, yet uttereth he these
    words in his booke <i>De vanitate scientiarum</i>: A certeine French
    protonotarie (saith he)<span class="sni"><i>C. Agrippa. cap. 51.</i></span>
    a lewd fellow and a coosener, hath written
    a certeine fable or miracle done at <i>Lions</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> What
    <i>Bodin</i> is, I knowe not, otherwise than by report; but
    I am certeine this his tale is a fond fable: and
    <i>Bodin</i> saith it was performed at <i>Lions</i>;
    and this man (as I under-

    the joining of hands with the divell, the kissing of his bare
    buttocks, and his scratching and biting of them, are absurd lies;
    everie one having the gift of reason may plainlie perceive: in so much
    as it is manifest unto us by the word of God, that a spirit hath no
    flesh, bones, nor sinewes, whereof hands, buttocks, claws, teeth, and
    lips doo consist. For admit that the constitution of a divels bodie (as
    <i>Tatian</i><span class="sni"><i>Tatianus contra Græcos.</i></span>
    and other affirme) consisteth in spirituall/<span class="snp" id="p_48"><i>48.</i></span> congelations,
    as of fier and aire; yet it cannot be perceived of mortall creatures.
    What credible witnesse is there brought at anie time, of this their
    corporall, visible, and incredible bargaine; saving the confession
    of some person diseased both in bodie and mind, wilfullie made, or
    injuriouslie constrained? It is mervell that no penitent witch that
    forsaketh hir trade, confesseth not these things without compulsion.
    Mee thinketh their covenant made at baptisme with God, before good
    witnesses, sanctified with the word, confirmed with his promises, and
    established with his sacraments, should be of more force than that
    which they make with the divell, which no bodie seeth or knoweth. For
    God deceiveth none, with whom he bargaineth; neither dooth he mocke or
    disappoint them, although he danse not among them.</p>

  <p>Their oth, to procure into their league and fellowship as manie as they
    can (whereby everie one witch, as <i>Bodin</i> affirmeth, augmenteth the
    number of fiftie) bewraieth greatlie their indirect dealing. Hereof I
    have made triall,<span class="sni">The author speaketh upon due proofe
    and triall.</span> as also of the residue of their coosening devices;
    and have beene with the best, or rather the woorst of them, to see what
    might be gathered out of their counsels; and have cunninglie treated
    with them thereabouts: and further, have sent certeine old persons to
    indent with them, to be admitted into their societie. But as well by
    their excuses and delaies, as by other circumstances, I have tried and
    found all their trade to be meere coosening.</p>

  <p>I praie you what bargaine have they made with the divell, that with
    their angrie lookes beewitch lambs, children, &amp;c? Is it not confessed,
    that it is naturall, though it be a lie? What bargaine maketh the
    soothsaier, which hath his severall kinds of witchcraft and divination
    expressed in the scripture? Or is it not granted that they make none?
    How chanceth it that we heare not of this bargaine in the scriptures?/</p>

    whosoever consideratelie beholdeth their confessions, shall perceive
    all to be vaine, idle, false, inconstant, and of no weight; except
    their contempt and ignorance in religion: which is rather the fault of
    the negligent pastor, than of the simple woman.</p>

  <p>First, if their confession<span class="sni">Confession compulsorie; as by Hispanicall inquisition: Looke
    <i>Mal. malef. &amp; Jo. Bodin.</i><br />
    Confession persuasorie; as by flatterie: Looke <i>Bry.<br /> Darcie</i> against
    <i>Ursu. Kempe.</i></span> be made by compulsion, of force or
    authoritie, or by persuasion, and under colour of freendship, it is not
    to be regarded; bicause the extremitie of threts and tortures provokes
    it; or the qualitie of faire words and allurements constraines it.
    If it be voluntarie, manie circumstances must be considered, to wit;
    whether she appeach not hir selfe to overthrow hir neighbour, which
    manie times happeneth through their cankered and malicious melancholike
    humor: then; whether in that same melancholike mood and frentike
    humor, she desire not the abridgment of hir owne daies. Which thing
    <i>Aristotle</i> saith dooth oftentimes happen unto persons subject to
    melancholike passions: and (as <i>Bodin</i><span class="sni"><i>John. Bod.<br />
    Mal. Malef.</i></span> and <i>Sprenger</i> saie) to these
    old women called witches, which manie times (as they affirme) refuse to
    live; thretning the judges, that if they may not be burned, they will
    laie hands upon themselves, and so make them guiltie of their damnation.</p>

  <p>I my selfe have knowne, that where such a one could not prevaile, to
    be accepted as a sufficient witnesse against himselfe, he presentlie
    went and threw himselfe into a pond of water, where he was drowned.
    But the lawe saith; <span class="sni"><i>L. absent. de poenis.</i></span>
    <i>Volenti mori non est habenda fides</i>, that is; His
    word is not to be credited that is desirous to/<span class="snp" id="p_50"><i>50.</i></span> die. Also sometimes (as
    <span class="sni"><i>L. 2. cum glos. de iis, qui ante sentent. mortui sunt, sibi
    necem consciscentes.</i></span>else-where I have prooved) they confesse that whereof they were never
    guiltie; supposing that they did that which they did not, by meanes of
    certeine circumstances. And as they sometimes confesse impossibilities,
    as that they flie in the aire, transubstantiate themselves, raise
    tempests, transfer or remoove corne, &amp;c: so doo they also (I saie)
    confesse voluntarilie, that which no man could proove, and that which
    no man would ghesse, nor yet beleeve, except he were as mad as they; so
    as they bring death wilfullie upon themselves: which argueth an unsound
    mind.</p>

  <p>If they confesse that, which hath beene indeed committed by them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> as
    poisoning, or anie other kind of murther, which falleth into the power
    of such persons to accomplish; I stand not to defend their cause.
    Howbeit, I would wish that even in that case there be not too rash
    credit given, nor too hastie proceedings used against them: but that
    the causes, properties, and circumstances of everie thing be dulie
    considered, and diligentlie examined.<span class="sni">Absurdities in
    witches confessions.</span> For you shall understand, that
    as sometimes they confesse they have murthered their neighbours with
    a wish, sometimes with a word, sometimes with a looke, &amp;c: so they
    confesse, that with/<span class="snp"><b>42.</b></span> the delivering of an apple, or some such thing, to
    a woman with child, they have killed the child in the mothers wombe,
    when nothing was added thereunto, which naturallie could be noisome or
    hurtfull.</p>

  <p>In like maner they confesse, that with a touch of their bare hand, they
    sometimes kill a man being in perfect health and strength of bodie;
    when all his garments are betwixt their hand and his flesh.</p>

  <p>But if this their confession be examined by divinitie, philosophie,
    physicke, lawe or conscience, it will be found false and insufficient.
    First, for that the working of miracles is ceased. Secondlie, no reason
    can be yeelded for a thing so farre beyond all reason. Thirdlie, no
    receipt can be of such efficacie, as when the same is touched with a
    bare hand, from whence the veines have passage through the bodie unto
    the hart, it should not annoie the poisoner; and yet reteine vertue and
    force enough, to pearse through so manie garments and the verie flesh
    incurablie, to the place of death in another person. <i>Cui argumento</i>
    (saith <i>Bodin</i>) <i>nescio quid / responderi possit.</i><span class="sni"><i>J.
    Bod. de dæmon. lib. 2. cap. 8.</i></span><span class="snp" id="p_51"><i>51.</i></span> Fourthlie, no lawe
    will admit such a confession, as yeeldeth unto impossibilities, against
    the which there is never any lawe provided; otherwise it would not
    serve a mans turne, to plead and proove that he was at <i>Berwicke</i> that
    daie, that he is accused to have doone a murther in <i>Canturburie</i>; for

    them, and also to enoble them; and finallie to endue them with all
    worldlie felicitie and pleasure: which is furthest from them of all
    other. Yea, if they were sensible, they would saie to the divell; Whie

    anie man advisedlie marke their words, actions, cogitations, and
    gestures, he shall perceive that melancholie abounding in their head,
    and occupieng their braine, hath deprived or rather depraved their
    judgements, and all their senses: I meane not of coosening witches,
    but of poore melancholike women, which are themselves deceived. For
    you shall understand, that the force which melancholie hath, and the
    effects that it worketh in the bodie of a man, or rather of a woman,
    are almost incredible. For as some of these melancholike persons
    imagine, they are witches/<span class="snp" id="p_53"><i>53.</i></span> and by witchcraft can worke woonders, and
    doo what they list: so doo other, troubled with this disease, imagine
    manie strange, incredible, and impossible things. Some, that they are
    monarchs and princes, and that all other men are their subjects: some,
    that they are brute beasts: some, that they be urinals or earthen pots,
    greatlie fearing to be broken: some, that everie one that meeteth them,
    will conveie them to the gallowes; and yet in the end hang themselves.
    One thought, that <i>Atlas</i>, whome the poets feigne to hold up heaven
    with his shoulders, would be wearie, and let the skie fall upon him:
    another would spend a whole daie upon a stage, imagining that he both
    heard and saw interludes, and therewith made himselfe great sport. One
    <i>Theophilus</i> a physician, otherwise sound inough of mind (as it is
    said) imagined that he heard and sawe musicians continuallie plaieng on
    instruments, in a certeine place of his house. One <i>Bessus</i>, that had
    killed his father, was notablie detected; by imagining that a swallowe
    upraided him therewith: so as he himselfe thereby revealed the murther.</p>

  <p>But the notablest example heereof is, of one that was in great
    perplexi/tie,<span class="snp"><b>44.</b></span><span class="sni">Of
    one that through melancholie was induced to thinke that
    he had a nose as big as a house, &amp;c.</span> imagining that his nose was as big as a house; insomuch
    as no freend nor physician could deliver him from this conceipt, nor
    yet either ease his greefe, or satisfie his fansie in that behalfe:
    till at the last, a physician more expert in this humor than the
    rest, used this devise following. First, when he was to come in at
    the chamber doore being wide open, he suddenlie staied and withdrew
    himselfe; so as he would not in any wise approch neerer than the doore.
    The melancholike person musing heereat, asked him the cause why he so
    demeaned himselfe? Who answered him in this maner: Sir, your nose is
    so great, that I can hardlie enter into your chamber but I shall touch
    it, and consequentlie hurt it. Lo (quoth he) this is the man that must
    doo me good; the residue of my freends flatter me,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> and would hide mine
    infirmitie from me. Well (said the physician) I will cure you, but you
    must be content to indure a little paine in the dressing: which he
    promised patientlie to susteine, and conceived certeine hope of his
    recoverie. Then entred the physician into the chamber, creeping close
    by the walles, seeming to feare the touching and hurting of his nose.
    Then did he blindfold him, which/<span class="snp" id="p_54"><i>54.</i></span> being doone, he caught him by the
    nose with a paire of pinsors, and threw downe into a tub, which he
    had placed before his patient, a great quantitie of bloud, with manie
    peeces of bullocks livers, which he had conveied into the chamber,
    whilest the others eies were bound up, and then gave him libertie to
    see and behold the same. He having doone thus againe twoo or three
    times, the melancholike humor was so qualified, that the mans mind
    being satisfied, his greefe was eased, and his disease cured.</p>

  <p><i>Thrasibulus</i>, otherwise called <i>Thrasillus</i>, being sore oppressed with
    this melancholike humor, imagined, that all the ships, which arrived
    at port <i>Pyræus</i>, were his: insomuch as he would number them, and
    command the mariners to lanch, &amp;c: triumphing at their safe returnes,
    and moorning for their misfortunes. The <i>Italian</i>, whom we called
    here in <i>England</i>, the Monarch, was possessed with the like spirit or
    conceipt. <i>Danæus</i><span class="sni"><i>Danæus in dialog. cap. 3.</i></span> himselfe reporteth, that he sawe one, that affirmed
    constantlie that he was a cocke; and saith that through melancholie,
    such were alienated from themselves.</p>

  <p>Now, if the fansie of a melancholike person may be occupied in causes
    which are both false and impossible;<span class="sni"><i>J. Baptist. P. N. cap. 2.<br />Card. de var. rerum.<br />
    J. Wier. de prestigiis dæmonum, &amp;c.<br />Aristotle.</i></span> why should an old witch be
    thought free from such fantasies, who (as the learned philosophers and
    physicians saie) upon the stopping of their monethlie melancholike
    flux or issue of bloud, in their age must needs increase therein,
    as (through their weaknesse both of bodie and braine) the aptest
    persons to meete with such melancholike imaginations: with whome their
    imaginations remaine, even when their senses are gone. Which <i>Bodin</i>
    <span class="sni"><i>John. Bod.</i></span>
    laboureth to disproove, therein shewing himselfe as good a physician,
    as else-where a divine.</p>

  <p>But if they may imagine, that they can transforme their owne
    bodies, which neverthelesse remaineth in the former shape: how
    much more credible is it, that they may falselie suppose they can
    hurt and infeeble other mens bodies; or which is lesse, hinder the
    comming of butter? &amp;c. But what is it that they will not imagine,
    and consequentlie confesse that they can doo; speciallie being so
    earnestlie persuaded thereunto, so sorelie tor/mented,<span class="snp"><b>45.</b></span> so craftilie
    examined, with such promises of favour, as wherby they imagine, that
    they shall ever after live in great credit &amp; welth? &amp;c.</p>

  <p>If you read the executions doone upon witches, either in times/<span class="snp" id="p_55"><i>55.</i></span>
    past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>

    I will cite a notable instance concerning this matter, the parties
    themselves being yet alive, and dwelling in the parish of <i>Sellenge</i> in
    <i>Kent</i>, and the matter not long sithence in this sort performed.</p>

  <p>One<span class="sni">A Kentish storie of a late accident.</span>
    <i>Ade Davie</i>, the wife of <i>Simon Davie</i>, husbandman, being reputed
    a right honest bodie, and being of good parentage, grew suddenlie (as
    hir husband informed mee, and as it is well knowne in these parts) to
    be somewhat pensive and more sad than in times past. Which thing though
    it greeved him, yet he was loth to make it so appeere, as either his
    wife might be troubled or discontented therewith, or his neighbours
    informed thereof; least ill husbandrie should be laid to his charge
    (which in these quarters is much abhorred.) But when she grew from
    pensivenes, to some perturbation of mind; so as hir accustomed rest
    began in the night season to be withdrawne from hir, through sighing
    and secret lamentation; and that, not without teares, hee could not
    but demand the cause of hir conceipt and extraordina/rie<span class="snp" id="p_56"><i>56.</i></span> moorning. But
    although at that time she covered the same, acknowledging nothing to
    be amisse with hir: soone after notwithstanding she fell downe before
    him on hir knees, desiring him to forgive hir, for she had greevouslie
    offended (as she said) both God &amp; him. Hir poore husband being abashed
    at this hir behaviour, comforted hir, as he could; asking hir the
    cause of hir trouble &amp; greefe: who told him, that she had, (contrarie
    to Gods lawe) &amp; to the offense of all good christians, to the injurie
    of him, &amp; speciallie to the losse of hir owne soule, bargained and
    given hir soule to the divell, to be delivered unto him within short
    space. <span class="sni">Note the christian comfort of the husbād to his wife.</span>
    Whereunto hir husband answered, saieng; Wife, be of good cheere,
    this thy bargaine is void and of none effect: for thou hast sold that
    which is none of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
    thine to sell; sith it belongeth to Christ, who hath
    bought it, and deerelie paid for it, even with his bloud, which he shed
    upon the crosse; so as the divell hath no interest in thee./<span class="snp"><b>46.</b></span> After
    this, with like submission, teares, and penitence, she said unto him;
    Oh husband, I have yet committed another fault, and doone you more
    injurie: for I have bewitched you and your children. Be content (quoth
    he) by the grace of God, Jesus Christ shall unwitch us: for none evill
    can happen to them that feare God.</p>

  <p>And (as trulie as the Lord liveth) this was the tenor of his words
    unto me, which I knowe is true, as proceeding from unfeigned lips,
    and from one that feareth God. Now when the time approched that the
    divell should come, and take possession of the woman, according to his
    bargaine, he watched and praied earnestlie, and caused his wife to
    read psalmes and praiers for mercie at Gods hands: and suddenlie about
    midnight, there was a great rumbling beelowe under his chamber windowe,
    which amazed them exceedinglie. For they conceived, that the divell was
    beelowe, though he had no power to come up, bicause of their fervent
    praiers.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Confutation.</span>He that noteth this womans first and second confession, freelie and
    voluntarilie made, how everie thing concurred that might serve to
    adde credit thereunto, and yeeld matter for hir condemnation, would
    not thinke, but that if <i>Bodin</i> were foreman of hir inquest, he would
    crie; Guiltie: &amp; would hasten execution upon hir; who would have said
    as much before any judge in/<span class="snp" id="p_57"><i>57.</i></span> the world, if she had beene examined; and
    have confessed no lesse, if she had beene arraigned therupon. But God
    knoweth, she was innocent of anie these crimes: howbeit she was brought
    lowe and pressed downe with the weight of this humor, so as both hir
    rest and sleepe were taken awaie from hir; &amp; hir fansies troubled
    and disquieted with despaire, and such other cogitations as grew by
    occasion thereof. And yet I beleeve, if any mishap had insued to hir
    husband, or his children; few witchmongers would have judged otherwise,
    but that she had bewitched them. And she (for hir part) so constantlie
    persuaded hir selfe to be a witch, that she judged hir selfe worthie of
    death; insomuch as being reteined in hir chamber, she sawe not anie one
    carrieng a faggot to the fier, but she would saie it was to make a fier
    to burne hir for witcherie. But God knoweth she had bewitched none,
    neither insued there anie hurt unto anie, by hir imagination, but unto
    hir selfe.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">A comicall catastrophe.</span>And as for the rumbling, it was by occasion of a sheepe, which was
    flawed, and hoong by the wals, so as a dog came and devoured it;
    whereby grew the noise which I before mentioned: and she being now
    recovered, remaineth a right honest woman, far from such impietie,
    and ashamed of hir imaginations, which she perceiveth to have growne
    through melancholie.</p>

  <p class="subhead"><i>The strange and divers effects of melancholie, and how the
    same humor abounding in witches, or rather old women,
    filleth them full of mervellous imaginations, and that their

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_b.png" width="75" height="75" alt='B' /></span>UT
    in truth,<span class="sni"><i>H. Card. de var. rerum. cap. 8.<br />
    Jo. Wierus de præst. lib. 6. cap. 8.</i></span> this melancholike humor (as the best physicians affirme)
    is the cause of all their strange, impossible, and incredible
    confessions:/<span class="snp"><b>47.</b></span> which are so fond, that I woonder how anie man can be
    abused thereby. Howbeit, these affections, though they appeare in
    the mind of man, yet are they bred in the bodie, and proceed from
    this humor, which is the verie dregs of bloud, nourishing and feeding
    those places, from whence proceed feares, co/gitations,<span class="snp" id="p_58"><i>58.</i></span> superstitions,
    fastings, labours, and such like.</p>

  <p>This maketh sufferance of torments, and (as some saie)<span class="sni"><i>Aristotle
    de somnio.</i></span> foresight of
    things to come, and preserveth health, as being cold and drie: it
    maketh men subject to leanenesse, and to the quartane ague. T<span class="sni"><i>H. Card. lib. 8 de var. rer.</i></span>hey that
    are vexed therewith, are destroiers of themselves, stout to suffer
    injuries, fearefull to offer violence; except the humor be hot. They
    learne strange toongs with small industrie (as <i>Aristotle</i> and others
    affirme.)</p>

  <p>If our witches phantasies were not corrupted, nor their wils confounded
    with this humor, they would not so voluntarilie and readilie confesse
    that which calleth their life in question; whereof they could never
    otherwise be convicted. <i>J. Bodin</i><span class="sni"><i>Jo. Bod. contra Jo. Wierum.</i></span>
    with his lawyers physicke reasoneth
    contrarilie; as though melancholie were furthest of all from those
    old women, whom we call witches: deriding the most famous and noble
    physician <i>John Wier</i> for his opinion in that behalfe. But bicause I
    am no physician, I will set a physician to him; namelie <i>Erastus</i>, who
    hath these words, to wit, that These witches, through their corrupt
    phantasie abounding with melancholike humors, by reason of their old
    age, doo dreame and imagine they hurt those things which they neither
    could nor doo hurt; and so thinke they knowe an art, which they neither
    have learned nor yet understand.</p>

  <p>But whie should there be more credit given to witches, when they
    saie they have made a reall bargaine with the divell, killed a cow,
    bewitched butter, infeebled a child, forespoken hir neighbour, &amp;c: than
    when she confesseth that she transubstantiateth hir selfe, maketh it
    raine or haile, flieth in the aire, goeth invisible, transferreth corne
    in the grasse from one field to another? &amp;c. If you thinke that in the
    one their confessions be sound, whie should you saie that they are
    corrupt in the other; the confession of all these things being made at
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
    one instant, and affirmed with like constancie, or rather audacitie?
    But you see the one to be impossible, and therefore you thinke thereby,
    that their confessions are vaine and false. The other you thinke may be
    doone, and see them confesse it, and therefore you conclude, <i>A posse
    ad esse</i>; as being persuaded it is so, bicause you thinke it may be so.
    But I saie, both with the divines,<span class="sni"><i>August. lib. de Trinit. 3.<br />Idem. de civit. Dei.<br />

    hath a vaine, an idle, and a childish persuasion, bred by an unsound

    extorted, or else proceed from an unsound mind. Yea I saie further,
    that we our selves, which are sound of mind, and yet seeke anie other
    waie of salvation than Christ Jesus, or breake his commandements, or
    walke not in his steps with a livelie faith, &amp;c: doo not onlie renounce
    the faith, but God himselfe: and therefore they (in confessing that
    they forsake God, and imbrace sathan) doo that which we all should
    doo. As touching that horrible part of their confession, in the league
    which tendeth to the killing of their owne and others children, the
    seething of them, and the making of their potion or pottage, and the
    effects thereof; their good fridaies meeting, being the daie of their
    deliverance, their incests, with their returne at the end of nine

    nor to returne, &amp;c; it is so horrible, unnaturall, unlikelie, and
    unpossible; that if I should behold such things with mine eies, I
    should rather thinke my selfe dreaming, dronken, or some waie deprived
    of my senses; than give credit to so horrible and filthie matters.</p>

    rotten: all which things are confessed by witches, and affirmed by
    writers to be the meanes that witches use to moove extraordinarie
    tempests and raine, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>We read in <i>M. Maleficarum</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Mal. Malef. par. 2. quæ. 1. cap. 12.</i></span>
    that a little girle walking abroad with
    hir father in his land, heard him complaine of drought, wishing for
    raine, &amp;c. Whie father (quoth the child) I can make it raine/<span class="snp" id="p_61"><i>61.</i></span> or haile,
    when and where I list? He asked where she learned it. She said, of
    hir mother, who forbad hir to tell anie bodie thereof. He asked hir
    how hir mother taught hir? She answered, that hir mother committed
    hir to a maister, who would at anie time doo anie thing for hir. Whie
    then (said he) make it raine but onlie in my field. And so she went
    to the streame, and threw up water in hir maisters name, and made it
    raine presentlie. And proceeding further with hir father, she made it
    haile in another field, at hir fathers request. Hereupon he accused
    his wife, and caused hir to be burned; and then he new christened
    his child againe: which circumstance is common among papists and
    witchmongers. And howsoever the first part hereof was
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> prooved, there
    is no doubt but the latter part was throughlie executed.
    <span class="sni">He that can lie, can steale; as he that can worke can plaie.</span> If they could
    indeed bring these things to passe at their pleasure, then might they
    also be impediments unto the course of all other naturall things, and
    ordinances appointed by God: as, to cause it to hold up, when it should
    raine; and to make midnight, of high noone: and by those meanes (I
    saie) the divine power should beecome servile to the will of a witch,
    so as we could neither eat nor drinke but by their permission.</p>

  <p>Me thinks <i>Seneca</i> might satisfie these credulous or rather idolatrous
    people, that runne a whorehunting, either in bodie or phansie, after
    these witches, beleeving all that is attributed unto them, to the
    derogation of Gods glorie. He saith, that the rude people, and our
    ignorant predecessors did beleeve, that raine and showers might be
    procured and staied by witches charmes and inchantments: of which kind
    of things that there can nothing be wrought, it is so manifest, that
    we need not go to anie philosophers schoole, to learne the confutation
    thereof.</p>

  <p>But <i>Jeremie</i><span class="sni">Jere. 16, 22.</span>, by the word of God, dooth utterlie confound all that
    which may be devised for the maintenance of that foolish opinion,
    saieng; Are there any among the gods<span class="sni"><i>Dii gentium dæmonia</i>,<br />The
    gods of the gentiles are divels.</span> of the gentiles, that sendeth
    raine, or giveth showers from heaven? Art not thou the selfe same
    our Lord God? We will trust in thee, for thou dooest and makest all
    these things. I may therefore with <i>Brentius</i> boldlie saie, that It is
    neither in the power of witches nor divels, to accomplish that matter;
    but in God onelie. For when exhalations are drawne and lifted up from
    out of the earth, by the power/<span class="snp" id="p_62"><i>62.</i></span> of the sunne, into the middle region
    of the aire,<span class="sni">The naturall generation of haile and raine.</span>
    the coldnes thereof constreineth and thickeneth those
    vapours; which being beecome clouds, are dissolved againe by the heate
    of the sunne, wherby raine or haile is ingendred; raine, if by the waie
    the drops be not frosen and made haile. These/<span class="snp"><b>50.</b></span> circumstances being
    considered with the course of the whole scripture, it can neither be in
    the power of witch or divell to procure raine, or faire weather.</p>

  <p>And whereas the storie of <i>Job</i> in this case is alledged against me
    (wherein a witch is not once named) I have particularlie answered
    it else-where. And therefore thus much onelie I say heere; that
    Even there, where it pleased God (as <i>Calvine</i> saith) to set downe
    circumstances for the instruction of our grosse capacities, which
    are not able to conceive of spirituall communication, or heavenlie
    affaires; the divell desireth God to stretch out his hand, and touch
    all that <i>Job</i><span class="sni">Job 1, 11.</span> hath. And though he seemeth to grant sathans desire, yet
    God himselfe sent fire from heaven, &amp;c. Where, it is to be gathered,
    that although God said, He is in thine hand: it was the Lords hand
    that punished <i>Job</i>,<span class="sni">Ib. verse 16.</span> and not the hand of the divell, who said not,
    Give me leave to plague him; but, Laie thine hand upon him. And when
    <i>Job</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
    continued faithfull notwithstanding all his afflictions, in his
    children, bodie and goods; the divell is said to come againe to God,
    and to saie as before, to wit: <span class="sni">Job 2, 5.</span>Now stretch out thine hand, and touch
    his bones and his flesh. Which argueth as well that he could not doo
    it, as that he himselfe did it not before. And be it here remembred,
    that <i>M. Mal.</i><span class="sni"><i>Mal. Malef. pa. 1, quæ. 2.</i></span>

    conteined in <i>M. Mal. Bodin</i>, &amp;c: or in the pamphlets late set foorth

    what needed such preparation of warres, or such trouble, or charge in
    that behalfe? No prince should be able to reigne or live in the land.
    For (as <i>Danæus</i> saith) that one <i>Martine</i> a witch killed the emperour
    of <i>Germanie</i> with witchcraft: so would our witches (if they could)
    destroie all our magistrates. One old witch might overthrowe an armie

    instruments of warre? A witch might supplie all wants, and accomplish a

  <p>If it be objected, that witches worke by the divell, and christian
    princes are not to deale that way; I answer, that few princes
    disposed to battell would make conscience therin, speciallie such as
    take unjust wars in hand, using other helpes, devises, &amp; engines as
    unlawfull and divelish as that; in whose campe there is neither the

    his bowe and arrowes three of the enimies, as they stood peeping over
    the walles of a castell besieged: so as in the end he killed them all
    quite, saving one. The triall of the archers sinister/<span class="snp" id="p_65"><i>65.</i></span> dealing, and a
    proofe thereof expressed, is; for that he never lightly failed when he
    shot, and for that he killed them by three a daie; and had shot three
    arrowes into a rood. This was he that shot at a pennie on his sonnes
    head, and made readie another arrow, to have slaine the duke <i>Remgrave</i>
    that commanded it. And doubtlesse, bicause of his singular dexteritie
    in shooting, he was reputed a witch, as dooing that which others could
    not doo, nor thinke to be in the power of man to doo: though indeed no
    miracle, no witchcraft, no impossibilitie nor difficultie consisted
    therein./<span class="snp"><b>52.</b></span></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

  <p>But this latter storie I can requite with a familiar example.
    <span class="sni">A skilfull archer punished by an unskilfull Justice.</span> For
    at Towne <i>Malling</i> in kent, one of Q. <i>Maries</i> justices, upon the
    complaint of many wise men, and a few foolish boies, laid an archer
    by the heeles; bicause he shot so neere the white at buts. For he
    was informed and persuaded, that the poore man plaied with a flie,
    otherwise called a divell or familiar. And bicause he was certified
    that the archer aforesaid shot better than the common shooting, which
    he before had heard of or seene, he conceived it could not be in Gods
    name, but by inchantment: whereby this archer (as he supposed by
    abusing the Queenes liege people) gained some one daie two or three
    shillings, to the detriment of the commonwealth, and to his owne
    inriching. And therefore the archer was severelie punished, to the
    great encouragement of archers, and to the wise example of justice;
    but speciallie to the overthrowe of witchcraft. And now againe to our
    matter.</p>

    following sathans provocations, being seduced by the illusion of
    divels, beleeve and professe, that in the night times ride abroad with
    <i>Diana</i>, the goddesse of the <i>Pagans</i>, or else with <i>Herodias</i>, with
    an innumerable multitude, upon certeine beasts, and passe over manie

    all ministers therefore in their severall cures, preach to Gods people,
    so as they may knowe all these things to be false, &amp;c. It followeth in

  <p>And if this be credible, then all these their bargaines and assemblies,

    <span class="snp"><b>53.</b></span>staied them, till he sent to the houses of those neighbours, which
    seemed to be there, and found them all in bed; and so tried, that these
    were divels in the likenesse of those women. Which if it were as true,
    as it is false, it might serve well to confute this their meeting and
    night-walking. For if the divels be onlie present in the likenesse of
    witches, then is that false, which is attributed to witches in this

    and is not authenticall but apocryphall; saieng (though untrulie) that
    that councell was not called by the commandement and pleasure of the

    to disanull all councels. For surelie (saith this frier, which at this
    instant is a cheefe inquisitor) if the words of this councell were to
    be admitted, both I, and all my predecessors had published notorious
    lies, and committed manie injurious executions; whereby the popes

    what creature being sound<span class="sni">It is not likelie they would so doo: <i>Ergo</i> a lie.</span>
    in state of mind, would (without
    compulsion) make such maner of confessions as they do; or would, for
    a trifle, or nothing, make a perfect bargaine with the divell for hir
    soule, to be yeelded up unto his tortures and everlasting flames, and
    that within a verie short time; speciallie being through age most
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
    commonlie unlike to live one whole yeare? The terror of hell fire must
    needs be to them diverslie manifested, and much more terrible; bicause
    of their weaknesse, nature, and kind, than to any other: as it would
    appeere, if a witch were but asked, Whether she would be contented
    to be hanged one yeare hence, upon condition hir displesure might be
    wreked upon hir enimie presentlie. As for theeves, &amp; such other, they
    thinke not to go to hell fire; but are either persuaded there is no
    hell, or that their crime deserveth it not, or else that they have time
    e/nough<span class="snp" id="p_69"><i>69.</i></span> to repent: so as, no doubt, if they were perfectlie resolved
    heereof, they would never make such adventures. Neither doo I thinke,
    that for any summe of monie, they would make so direct a bargaine to
    go to hell fire. Now then I conclude, that confession in this behalf
    is insufficient to take awaie the life of any body; or to atteine such
    credit, as to be beleeved without further proofe. For as <i>Augustine</i>
    <span class="sni"><i>August. de civit.<br />Dei. Isidor. lib. (8. cap. 9.)<br />

    and <i>Isidore</i>, with the rest of the sounder divines saie, that these
    prestigious things, which are wrought by witches are fantasticall: so
    doo the sounder decrees of councels and canons agree, that in that
    case, there is no place for criminall action. And the lawe saith, that
    The confession of such persons as are illuded, must needs be erronious,
    and therefore is not to be admitted: for, <i>Confessio debet tenere verum
    &amp; possibile</i>. But these things are opposite both to lawe and nature,
    and therfore it followeth not; Bicause these witches confesse so,
    <i>Ergo</i> it is so. For the confession differeth from the act, or from the
    possibilitie of the act. And whatsoever is contrarie to nature faileth
    in his principles, and therefore is naturallie impossible.</p>

  <p>The lawe also saith, <i>In criminalibus regulariter non statur soli
      confessioni rei</i>, In criminall cases or touching life, we must not
    absolutelie stand to the confession of the accused partie: but in
    these matters proofes must be brought more cleare than the light it
    selfe. And in this crime no bodie must be condemned upon presumptions.
    And where it is objected and urged, that Since God onelie knoweth
    the thoughts, therefore there is none other waie of proofe/<span class="snp"><b>55.</b></span> but by
    confession: It is answered thus in the lawe, to wit: Their confession
    in this case conteineth an outward act, and the same impossible both
    in lawe and nature, and also unlikelie to be true; and therefore <i>Quod
    verisimile non est, attendi non debet</i>. So as, though their confessions
    may be worthie of punishment, as whereby they shew a will to commit
    such mischeefe, yet not worthie of credit, as that they have such
    power. For, <i>Si factum absit, soláque opinione laborent, é stultorum
    genere sunt</i>; If they confesse a fact performed but in opinion, they
    are to be reputed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
    among the number of fooles. Neither may any man be
    by lawe condemned for criminall causes, upon presumptions, nor yet by
    single witnesses: neither at the accusation of a capitall enimie, who
    indeed is not to be admitted to give evidence in this case; though it
    please/<span class="snp" id="p_70"><i>70.</i></span> <i>M. Mal.</i> and <i>Bodin</i> to affirme the contrarie. But beyond all
    equitie, these inquisitors have shifts and devises enow, to plague and
    kill these poore soules: for (they say)<span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef. quæst. 14. pa. 1.</i></span> their fault is greatest of
    all others; bicause of their carnall copulation with the divell, and
    therefore they are to be punished as heretikes, foure maner of waies:
    to wit; with excommunication, deprivation, losse of goods, and also
    with death.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>C. de malef. L. nullus. L nemo. &amp; L. culpa. and affirmed by
    Mal. malef.</i></span>And indeede they find lawe, and provide meanes thereby to mainteine
    this their bloudie humor. For it is written in their popish canons,
    that As for these kind of heretikes, how much soever they repent
    and returne to the faith, they may not be reteined alive, or kept
    in perpetuall prison; but be put to extreame death. Yea, <i>M. Mal.</i><span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef. quæst. 17.</i></span>
    writeth, that A witches sinne is the sinne against the Holie-ghost; to
    wit, irremissible: yea further, that it is greater than the sinne of
    the angels that fell. In which respect I wonder, that <i>Moses</i> delivered
    not three tables to the children of Israell; or at the leastwise, that
    he exhibited not commandements for it. It is not credible that the
    greatest should be included in the lesse, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>But when these witchmongers are convinced in the objection concerning
    their confessions; so as thereby their tyrannicall arguments cannot
    prevaile, to imbrue the magistrates hands in so much bloud as their
    appetite requireth: they fall to accusing them of other crimes,
    that the world might thinke they had some colour to mainteine their
    malicious furie against them.</p>

    <span class="sni">1. Idolatrie, confuted.</span>
    therefore they laie to their charge idolatrie. But alas without
    all reason: for such are properlie knowne to us to be idolaters, as doo
    externall worship to idols or strange gods. The furthest point that
    idolatrie can be stretched unto, is, that they, which are culpable
    therein, are such as hope for and seeke salvation at/<span class="snp" id="p_71"><i>71.</i></span> the hands of
    idols, or of anie other than God; or fix their whole mind and love
    upon anie creature, so as the power of God be neglected and contemned
    thereby. But witches nei/ther<span class="snp"><b>56.</b></span> seeke nor beleeve to have salvation
    at the hands of divels, but by them they are onlie deceived; the
    instruments of their phantasie being corrupted, and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> so infatuated,
    that they suppose, confesse, and saie they can doo that, which is as
    farre beyond their power and nature to doo, as to kill a man at <i>Yorke</i>
    before noone, when they have beene seene at <i>London</i> in that morning,
    &amp;c. But if these latter idolaters, whose idolatrie is spirituall, and
    committed onelie in mind, should be punished by death; then should
    everie covetous man, or other, that setteth his affection anie waie
    too much upon an earthlie creature, be executed, and yet perchance the
    witch might escape scotfree.</p>

  <p>Secondlie,<span class="sni">2. Apostasie, confuted.</span>
    apostasie is laid to their charge, whereby it is inferred,
    that they are worthie to die. But apostasie is, where anie of sound
    judgement forsake the gospell, learned and well knowne unto them; and
    doo not onelie imbrace impietie and infidelitie; but oppugne and resist
    the truth erstwhile by them professed. But alas these poore women go
    not about to defend anie impietie, but after good admonition repent.</p>

  <p>Thirdlie,<span class="sni">3. Seducing of the people, confuted.</span> they would have them executed for seducing the people. But
    God knoweth they have small store of Rhetorike or art to seduce; except
    to tell a tale of Robin good-fellow be to deceive and seduce. Neither
    may their age or sex admit that opinion or accusation to be just: for
    they themselves are poore seduced soules. I for my part (as else-where
    I have said) have prooved this point to be false in most apparent sort.</p>

  <p>Fourthlie,<span class="sni">4. Carnall copulation with Incubus, confuted.</span> as touching the accusation, which all the writers use
    herein against them for their carnall copulation with <i>Incubus</i>: the
    follie of mens credulitie is as much to be woondered at and derided,
    as the others vaine and impossible confessions. For the divell is
    a spirit, and hath neither flesh nor bones, which were to be used
    in the performance of this action. And since he also lacketh all
    instruments, substance, and seed ingendred of bloud; it were follie
    to staie overlong in the confutation of that, which is not in the
    nature of things. And yet must I saie somewhat heerein, bicause the
    opinion hereof is so stronglie and universallie received,/<span class="snp" id="p_72"><i>72.</i></span> and the
    fables hereupon so innumerable; wherby <i>M. Mal. Bodin</i>, <i>Hemingius</i>,
    <i>Hyperius</i>, <i>Danæus</i>, <i>Erastus</i>, and others that take upon them to
    write heerein, are so abused, or rather seeke to abuse others; as I
    woonder at their fond credulitie in this behalfe. For they affirme
    undoubtedlie, that the divell plaieth
    <i>Succubus</i><span class="sni">How the divell plaieth Succubus and Incubus.</span> to the man, and carrieth from him the seed of generation,
    which he delivereth as <i>Incubus</i> to the woman, who manie

    that as they take bodies, and the likenesse of members; so they take
    minds and similitudes of their operations. But by the way, I would have
    them answer this question. Our minds and soules are spirituall things.
    If our corporall eares be stopped, what can they heare or conceive of
    anie externall wisedome? And truelie, a man of such a constitution of
    bodie, as they imagine of these spirits, which make themselves, &amp;c:

    togither; as was confessed by fourtie and eight witches burned at
    <i>Ravenspurge</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
    But what goodlie fellowes <i>Incubus</i> begetteth upon

  <p>This<span class="sni">Gen. 6, 4.</span> is prooved first by the divels cunning, in discerning the
    difference of the seed which falleth from men. Secondlie, by his
    understanding of the aptnes of the women for the receipt of such seed.
    Thirdlie by his knowledge of the constellations, which are freendlie
    to such corporall effects. And lastlie, by the excellent complexion of
    such as the divell maketh choice of, to beget such notable personages
    upon, as are the/<span class="snp"><b>59.</b></span> causes of the greatnesse and excellencie of the child
    thus begotten.</p>

  <p>And to proove that such bawdie dooings<span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef.
    par. 2. quæ. 1<br />August. de doctrina Christ.</i></span> betwixt the divell and witches
    is not fained, S. <i>Augustine</i> is alledged, who saith, that All
    superstitious arts had their beginning of the pestiferous societie
    betwixt the divell and man. Wherein he saith truelie; for that in
    paradise, betwixt the divell and man, all wickednes was so contrived,
    that man ever since hath studied wicked arts: yea and the divell will
    be sure to be at the middle and at both ends of everie mischeefe. But
    that the divell ingendreth with a woman, in maner and forme as is
    supposed, and naturallie begetteth the wicked, neither is it true, nor
    <i>Augustines</i> meaning in this place.</p>

  <p>Howbeit <i>M. Mal.</i> proceedeth, affirming that All witches take/<span class="snp" id="p_75"><i>75.</i></span> their
    beginning from such filthie actions, wherein the divell, in likenes
    of a prettie wench, lieth prostitute as <i>Succubus</i> to the man, and
    reteining his nature and seede, conveieth it unto the witch, to whome
    he delivereth it as <i>Incubus</i>. Wherein also is refuted the opinion of
    them that hold a spirit to be unpalpable. <i>M. Mal.</i><span class="sni"><i>Mal.
    malef. quæ. 1. par. 1.</i></span> saith, There can
    be rendred no infallible rule, though a probable distinction may be
    set downe, whether <i>Incubus</i> in the act of venerie doo alwaies powre
    seed out of his assumed bodie. And this is the distinction; Either she
    is old and barren, or yoong and pregnant. If she be barren, then dooth
    <i>Incubus</i> use hir without decision of seed; bicause such seed should
    serve for no purpose. And the divell avoideth superfluitie as much as
    he may; and yet for hir pleasure and condemnation togither, he goeth
    to worke with hir. But by the waie, if the divell were so compendious,
    what should he need to use such circumstances, even in these verie
    actions, as to make these assemblies, conventicles, ceremonies, &amp;c:
    when he hath alreadie bought their bodies, and bargained for their
    soules? Or what reason had he, to make them kill so manie infants, by
    whom he rather loseth than gaineth any thing; bicause they are, so
    farre as either he or we knowe, in better case than we of riper yeares
    by reason of their innocencie? Well, if she be not past children, then
    stealeth he seed awaie (as hath beene said) from
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> some wicked man being
    about that lecherous busines, and therewith getteth yoong witches upon
    the old.</p>

  <p>And note, that they affirme that this businesse is better accomplished
    with seed thus gathered, than that which is shed in dremes, through
    superfluitie of humors: bicause that is gathered from the vertue of the
    seed generative. And if it be said that the seed will wax cold by the
    waie, and so lose his naturall heate, and consequentlie the vertue: <i>M.

    it, as no heate shall go from it, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, old witches are sworne to procure as manie yoong virgins

    closeth togither againe: so as, although the goodwife be some times

    shall heare certeine stories out of <i>M. Mal.</i> worthie to be noted.</p>

  <p>A yoong priest at <i>Mespurge</i><span class="sni"><i>Mal. Malef. cap.
    6. quæ. 1 pa. 2.</i></span> in the diocesse of <i>Constance</i> was
    bewitched, so as he had no power to occupie any other or mo women than
    one; and to be delivered out of that thraldom, sought to flie into
    another countrie, where he might use that preestlie occupation more
    freelie. But all in vaine; for evermore he was brought as far backward
    by night, as he went forward in the daie before; sometimes by land,
    sometimes in the aire, as though he flew. And if this be not true, I am
    sure that <i>James Sprenger</i> dooth lie.</p>

  <p>For the further confirmation of our beleefe in <i>Incubus</i>, <i>M. Mal.</i>
    citeth a storie of a notable matter executed at <i>Ravenspurge</i>, as true
    and as cleanlie/<span class="snp"><b>61.</b></span> as the rest. A yoong man lieng with a wench in that
    towne (saith he) was faine to leave his instruments of venerie behind
    him, by meanes of that prestigious art of witchcraft: so as in that
    place nothing could be seene or felt but his plaine bodie. This yoong
    man was willed by another witch, to go to hir whom he suspected, and
    by faire or fowle meanes to require hir helpe: who soone after meeting
    with hir, intreated hir faire, but that was in vaine; and therefore
    he caught hir by the throte, and with a towell strangled hir, saieng:
    Restore me my/<span class="snp" id="p_78"><i>78.</i></span> toole, or thou shalt die for it: so as she being swolne
    and blacke in the face, and through his boisterous handling readie to
    die, said; Let me go, and I will helpe thee. And whilest he was loosing
    the towell, she put hir hand into his codpeece, and touched the place;
    saieng; Now hast thou thy desire: and even at that instant he felt
    himselfe restored.</p>

  <p>Item,<span class="sni"><i>Ja. Sprenger. in Mal. malef. par. 2. quæ.
    1.</i></span> a reverend father, for his life, holinesse, and knowledge
    notorious, being a frier of the order and companie of <i>Spire</i>,
    reported, that a yoong man at shrift made lamentable moane unto him for
    the like losse: but his gravitie suffered him not to beleeve lightlie
    any such reports, and therefore made the yoong man untrusse his
    codpeece point, and sawe the complaint to be true and just. Whereupon
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
    he advised or rather injoined the youth to go to the witch whome he
    suspected, and with flattering words to intreat hir, to be so good
    unto him, as to restore him his instrument: which by that meanes he
    obteined, and soone after returned to shew himselfe thankfull; and
    told the holie father of his good successe in that behalfe: but he so
    beleeved him, as he would needs be <i>Oculatus testis</i>, and made him pull
    downe his breeches, and so was satisfied of the troth and certeintie
    thereof.</p>

  <p>Another yoong man being in that verie taking,<span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef. cap. 7. par. 2. quæst. 1.</i></span> went to a witch for the
    restitution thereof, who brought him to a tree, where she shewed him
    a nest, and bad him clime up and take it. And being in the top of the
    tree, he tooke out a mightie great one, and shewed the same to hir,
    asking hir if he might not have the same. Naie (quoth she) that is our
    parish preests toole, but take anie other which thou wilt. And it is
    there affirmed, that some have found 20. and some 30. of them in one

    being wearied with the rehearsall of so manie lecheries most
    horrible, and very filthie and fabulous actions and passions of
    witches, together with the spirit <i>Incubus</i>, I will end with a true
    storie taken out of <i>Jason Pratensis</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Jaso.
    Pratensis de cerebri morbo, ca. 16.</i></span> which though it be rude, yet is
    it not altogither so uncleane as the rest.</p>

  <p>There came (saith he) of late a masse priest unto me, making pitious
    moane, and saieng, that if I holpt him not, he should be undoone, and
    utterlie overthrowne; so great was his infirmitie: for (saith he) I
    was woont to be faire and fat, and of an excellent complexion; and lo
    how I looke, being now a verie ghost consisting of skinne and bone,
    &amp;c. What is the matter (quoth <i>Jason</i>?) I will shew you sir, said
    the priest. There commeth unto mee, almost everie night, a certeine
    woman, unknowne unto me, and/<span class="snp"><b>65.</b></span> lieth so heavie upon my brest, that I
    cannot fetch my breath, neither have anie power to crie, neither doo
    my hands serve me to shoove hir awaie, nor my feete to go from hir. I
    smiled (quoth <i>Jason</i>) and told him that he was vexed with a disease
    called <i>In/cubus</i>,<span class="snp" id="p_84"><i>84.</i></span> or the mare; and the residue was phantasie and
    vaine imagination. Naie (said the priest)<span class="sni">The priest is
    opinionative in the error of his phantasie.</span> it cannot be so: for by our
    blessed ladie, I tell you nothing but that with waking I saw with mine
    eies, and felt with mine hands. I see hir when she commeth upon me,
    and strive to repell hir; but I am so infeebled that I cannot: and
    for remedie I have runne about from place to place, but no helpe that
    I could get. At length I went to an old frier that was counted an od
    fellow; and thought to have had help at his hands, but the divell a
    whit had I of him; saving that for remedie he willed me to praie to
    God; whome I am sure I wearied with my tedious praiers long before.
    Then went I unto an old woman (quoth the priest) who was said to be
    a cunning witch: and she willed me, that the next morning, about the
    dawning of the daie, I should pisse, and immediatlie should cover the
    pispot, or stop it with my right netherstocke, and before night the
    witch should come to visit me. And although (quoth he) the respect of
    mine orders somewhat terrified me from the execution of hir advise;
    yet my necessities diverse waies, and speciallie my paines moved me
    to make triall of hir words. And by the masse (quoth the priest) hir
    prophesie fell out as sure as a club. For a witch came to my house, and
    complained of a greefe in hir bladder, and that she could not pisse.
    But I could neither by faire nor fowle meanes obteine at
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span> hir hands,
    that she would leave molesting me by night; but she keepeth hir old
    custome, determining by these filthie meanes to dispatch me.<span class="sni">The priest recovered.</span> I could
    hardlie (saith <i>Jason</i>) reclaime him from this mad humor; but by that
    time he had beene with me three or foure times, he began to comfort
    himselfe, and at last perceiving it, he acknowledged his disease, and
    recovered the same./</p>

  <p class="subhead"><i>A confutation of all the former follies touching Incubus,
    which by examples and proofes of like stuffe is shewed to be
    flat knaverie, wherein the carnall copulation with spirits is overthrowne.</i></p>

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_t.png" width="75" height="75" alt='T' /></span>HUS
    are lecheries covered with the cloke of <i>Incubus</i> and witchcraft,
    contrarie to nature and veritie: and with these fables is mainteined an
    opinion, that men have beene begotten without carnall copulation (as
    <i>Hyperius</i> and others write that <i>Merlin</i><span class="sni">Merlin
    begotten of Incubus.</span> was, An. 440.) speciallie to
    excuse and mainteine the knaveries and lecheries of idle priests and
    bawdie monkes; and to cover the shame of their lovers and concubines.</p>

  <p>And alas, when great learned men have beene so abused, with the
    imagination of <i>Incubus</i> his carnall societie with women, misconstruing
    the scriptures, to wit, the place in <i>Genesis</i> 6. to the seducing of
    manie others; it is the lesse woonder, that this error hath passed so
    generallie among the common people./<span class="snp"><b>66.</b></span></p>

  <p>But to use few words herein, I hope you understand that they affirme
    and saie, that <i>Incubus</i> is a spirit; and I trust you know that a
    spirit hath no flesh nor bones, &amp;c: and that he neither dooth eate nor
    drinke. In deede your grandams maides were woont to set a boll of milke
    before him and his cousine Robin good-fellow, for grinding of malt or
    mustard, and sweeping the house at midnight: and you have also heard
    that he would chafe exceedingly, if the maid or good-wife of the house,
    having compassion of his nakednes, laid anie clothes for him, beesides
    his messe of white bread and milke, which was his standing fee. For in
    that case he saith; What have we here? Hemton hamten, here will I never
    more tread nor stampen.</p>

  <p>But to proceed in this confutation.<span class="sni"><i>Quia humor
    spermaticus ex succo alimentari provenit.</i></span> Where there is no meate eaten,
    there can be no seed which thereof is ingendred: although it be
    granted, that Robin could both eate and drinke, as being a/<span class="snp" id="p_86"><i>86.</i></span> cousening
    idle frier, or some such roge, that wanted nothing either belonging to
    lecherie or knaverie, &amp;c. Item, where the genitall members want, there
    can be no lust of the flesh: neither dooth nature give anie desire of
    generation, where there is no propagation or succession required.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

  <p>And as spirits cannot be greeved with hunger, so can they not be
    inflamed with lustes. And if men should live ever, what needed
    succession or heires? For that is but an ordinance of God, to supplie
    the place, the number, the world, the time, and speciallie to
    accomplish his will.<span class="sni"><i>Ad facultatem generandi tam interna quàm externa organa
    requiruntur.</i></span> But the power of generation consisteth not onlie
    in members, but chieflie of vitall spirits, and of the hart: which
    spirits are never in such a bodie as <i>Incubus</i> hath, being but a bodie
    assumed, as they themselves saie. And yet the most part of writers
    herein affirme, that it is a palpable and visible bodie; though all be
    phansies and fables that are written hereupon.</p>

    that I may with the verie absurdities, conteined in their owne

    confound them that mainteine the transubstantiations of witches; I will
    shew you certeine proper stuffe, which <i>Bodin</i><span class="sni"><i>J. Bod.
    lib. 2. de dæmon. cap, 6.</i></span> (their cheefe champion
    of this age) hath gathered out of <i>M. Mal.</i> and others, whereby he
    laboureth to establish this impossible, incredible, and supernaturall,
    or rather unnaturall doctrine of transubstantiation.</p>

  <p>First, as touching the divell (<i>Bodin</i> saith)<span class="sni">J.
    Bodin abuseth scripture to proove a lie.</span> that he dooth most
    properlie and commonlie transforme himselfe into a gote, confirming
    that opinion by the 33. and 34. of <i>Esaie</i>: where there is no one
    title*<span class="sni">[* = tittle.]</span>
    sounding to anie such purpose. Howbeit, he sometimes alloweth
    the divell the shape of a blacke Moore, and as he saith he used to
    appeare to <i>Mawd Cruse</i>, <i>Kate Darey</i>, and <i>Jone Harviller</i>. But I
    mervell, whether the divell createth himselfe, when he appeareth in
    the likenesse of a man; or whether God createth him, when the divell
    wisheth it. As for witches, he saith they speciallie transubstantiate
    themselves into wolves, and them whom they bewitch into asses: though
    else-where he differ somewhat herein/<span class="snp" id="p_90"><i>90.</i></span> from himselfe. But though he
    affirme,<span class="sni"><i>Pudendis tunc primùm erumpentibus.</i></span>
    that it may be naturallie brought to passe, that a girle shall
    become a boie; and that anie female maybe turned into the male: yet he
    saith the same hath no affinitie with <i>Lycanthropia</i>; wherein he saith
    also, that men are wholie transformed, and citeth infinite examples
    hereof.</p>

  <p>First, that one <i>Garner</i> in the shape of a woolfe killed a girle of
    the age of twelve yeares, and did eat up hir armes and legges, and
    carried the rest home to his wife. Item, that <i>Peter Burget</i>, and
    <i>Michael Werdon</i>, having turned themselves with an ointment into
    woolves, killed, and finallie did eate up an infinite number of people.
    Which lie <i>Wierus</i><span class="sni"><i>Jo. Wier. lib. 6. de mag ca. 12.</i></span>
    dooth sufficientlie confute. But untill you see
    and read that, consider whether <i>Peter</i> could eate rawe flesh without
    surfetting, speciallie flesh of his owne kind. Item, that there was
    an arrowe shot into a woolves thigh, who afterwards being turned into
    his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>former shape of a man, was found in his bed, with the arrowe in
    his thigh, which the archer that shot it knew verie well. Item, that
    another being <i>Lycanthropus</i> in the forme of a woolfe, had his woolves
    feet cut off, and in a moment he became a man without hands or feete.</p>

  <p>He accuseth<span class="sni"><i>J. Bodinus mendaciorum *heluo.</i></span><span class="sni">[* Text <i>helüo</i>.]</span> also one of the mightiest princes in christendome, even of
    late daies, to be one of those kind of witches (so as he could, when
    he list, turne himselfe to a woolfe) affirming that he was espied and
    oftentimes seene to performe that villanie; bicause he would be counted
    the king of all witches. He saith that this transubstantiation is most
    common in <i>Greece</i>,/<span class="snp"><b>70.</b></span> and through out all <i>Asia</i>, as merchant strangers
    have reported to him. For <i>Anno Domini.</i> 1542, when <i>Sultan Solimon</i>
    reigned, there was such force and multitude of these kind of woolves in
    <i>Constantinople</i>, that the emperour drave togither in one flocke 150.
    of them, which departed out of the citie in the presence of all the
    people.</p>

  <p>To persuade us<span class="sni">A warme season to swim in.</span> the more throughlie heerein, he saith, that in
    <i>Livonia</i>, yearelie (about the end of December) a certeine knave or
    divell warneth all the witches in the countrie to come to a certeine
    place: if they faile, the divell<span class="sni">I mervell that they forsake not the divell, who punisheth
    them so sore: ywis they get not so much at his hands.</span> commeth and whippeth them with an
    iron rod; so as the print of his lashes remaine upon their bodies for
    ever. The capteine witch leadeth the waie through a/<span class="snp" id="p_91"><i>91.</i></span> great poole of
    water: manie millians of witches swim after. They are no sooner passed
    through that water, but they are all transformed into woolves, and flie
    upon and devoure both men, women, cattell, &amp;c. After twelve daies they
    returne through the same water, and so receive humane shape againe.</p>

  <p>Item, that there was one <i>Bajanus</i> a <i>Jew</i>, being the sonne of
    <i>Simeon</i>, which could, when he list, turne himselfe into a woolfe; and
    by that meanes could escape the force and danger of a whole armie of
    men. Which thing (saith <i>Bodin</i>) is woonderfull: but yet (saith he) it
    is much more marvelous, that men will not beleeve it. For manie poets
    affirme it; yea, and if you looke well into the matter (saith he) you
    shall find it easie to doo. Item, he saith, that as naturall woolves
    persecute beasts; so doo these magicall woolves devoure men, women,
    and children.<span class="sni">Leviti. 16. [26, 22]</span> And yet God saith to the people (I trowe) and not to the
    cattell of Israell;<span class="sni">Deut. 32. [v. 24]</span> If you observe not my commandements, I will send
    among you the beasts of the feeld, which shall devoure both you and
    your cattell. Item, I will send the teeth of beasts upon you. Where is
    <i>Bodins</i> distinction now become? He never saith, I will send witches in
    the likenes of wolves, &amp;c: to devoure you or your cattell. Nevertheles,
    <i>Bodin</i> saith it is a cleare case: for the matter was disputed upon
    before pope <i>Leo</i> the seventh, and by him all these matters
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>were
    judged possible: and at that time (saith he) were the transformations
    of <i>Lucian</i> and <i>Apuleius</i> made canonicall.</p>

  <p>Furthermore he saith,<span class="sni">Stasus a witch could not be apprehended,
    and why?</span> that through this art they are so cunning that
    no man can apprehend them, but when they are a sleepe. Item, he nameth
    another witch, that (as <i>M. Mal.</i> saith) could not be caught, bicause
    he would transforme himselfe into a mouse, and runne into everie little
    hole, till at length he was killed comming out of the hole of a jamme
    <span class="sni"><i>J. Bodin. Mal. malef.</i></span>
    in a windowe: which indeed is as possible, as a camell to go through a
    needels eie. Item, he saith, that diverse witches at <i>Vernon</i> turned
    themselves into cats, and both committed and received much hurt. But
    at <i>Argentine</i><span class="sni"><i>John. Bodin. Mal. malef. Barth.
    Spin. &amp;c.</i></span> there was a wonderfull matter done, by three witches of
    great wealth, who transforming themselves into three cats, assalted a
    faggot-maker: who having hurt them all with a faggot sticke, was like
    to have beene put to death.<span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef. part. 3.</i></span> But he was miraculouslie delivered, and
    they worthilie punished; as the storie saith, from whence/<span class="snp" id="p_92"><i>92.</i></span> <i>Bodin</i> had
    it.</p>

  <p>After<span class="sni">An error about Lycanthropia.</span> a great manie other such beastlie fables, he inveieth against
    such physicians, as saie that <i>Lycanthropia</i> is a disease, and not a
    transformation. Item, he mainteineth, as sacred and true, all <i>Homers</i>
    fables of <i>Circes</i> and/<span class="snp"><b>71.</b></span> <i>Ulyffes</i> his companions: inveieng against
    <i>Chrysostome</i>, who rightlie interpreteth *<i>Ho</i>mers<span class="sni">[* Sic.]</span> meaning to be,
    that <i>Ulyffes</i> his people were by the harlot <i>Circes</i> made in their
    brutish maners to resemble swine.</p>

  <p>But least some poets fables might be thought lies (whereby the
    witchmongers arguments should quaile) he mainteineth for true the
    most part of <i>Ovids Metamorphôsis</i>, and the greatest absurdities and
    impossibilities in all that booke: marie he thinketh some one tale
    therein may be fained. Finallie, he confirmeth all these toies by the
    storie of <i>Nabuchadnez-zar</i>. And bicause (saith he) <i>Nabuchadnez-zar</i>
    continued seven yeres in the shape of a beast, therefore may witches
    remaine so long in the forme of a beast; having in all the meane
    time, the shape, haire, voice, strength, agilitie, swiftnes, food and
    excrements of beasts, and yet reserve the minds and soules of women
    or men. Howbeit, <i>S. Augustine</i><span class="sni"><i>August. lib. 8 de
    civit. Dei. cap. 18.<br />Idem. lib. de spiritu &amp; anima, cap. 26.</i></span>
    (whether to confute or confirme that
    opinion judge you) saith; <i>Non est credendum, humanum corpus dæmonum
    arte vel potestate in bestialia lineamenta converti posse</i>: We may
    not beleeve that a mans bodie may be altered into the lineaments of a
    beast by the divels art or power. Item, <i>Bodin</i> saith, that the reason
    whie witches are most commonlie turned into woolves, is; bicause they
    usuallie eate children, as woolves eate cattell. Item, that the cause
    whie other are truelie turned into asses, is; for that such have beene
    desirous to understand the secrets of witches. Whie witches are turned
    into cats, he <span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>alledgeth no reason, and therefore (to helpe him foorth
    with that paraphrase)<span class="sni"><i>Ironia.</i></span> I saie, that witches are curst queanes, and
    manie times scratch one another, or their neighbours by the faces; and
    therefore perchance are turned into cats. But I have put twentie of
    these witchmongers to silence with this one question; to wit, Whether a
    witch that can turne a woman into a cat, &amp;c: can also turne a cat into
    a woman?/</p>

    that no man useth this distinction in the definition of a man. But to
    what end should one dispute against these creations, and recreations;
    when <i>Bodin</i> washeth away all our arguments with one word, confessing
    that none can create any thing but God; acknowledging also the force
    of the canons, and imbracing the opinions of such divines, as write
    against him in this behalfe? Yea he dooth now (contrarie to himselfe
    elsewhere) affirme, that the divell cannot alter his forme. And lo,
    this is his distinction,<span class="sni"><i>J. Bod. lib. 2. de mag. dæmon.

    figura solùm permutatur</i>: The essentiall forme (to wit, reason) is not
    changed, but the shape or figure. And thereby he prooveth it easie
    enough to create men or beasts with life, so as they remaine without
    reason. Howbeit, I thinke it is an easier matter, to turne <i>Bodins</i>
    reason into the reason of an asse, than his bodie into the shape of
    a sheepe: which he saith is an easie matter;<span class="sni">Gen. 19, 24.
    &amp; 26. &amp; 27.</span> bicause <i>Lots</i>/<span class="snp"><b>72.</b></span> wife
    was turned into a stone by the divell. Whereby he sheweth his grosse
    ignorance. As though God that commanded <i>Lot</i> upon paine of death
    not to looke backe, who also destroied the citie of <i>Sodome</i> at that
    instant, had not also turned hir into a salt stone. And as though all
    this while God had beene the divels drudge, to go about this businesse
    all the night before, and when a miracle should be wrought, the divell
    must be faine to doo it himselfe.</p>

    <i>M. Mal. pa. 1. quæ. 9.</i></span> he affirmeth, that these kind of transfigurations are more common
    with them in the west parts of the world, than with us here in the
    east. Howbeit, this note is given withall; that that is ment of the
    second persons, and not of the first: to wit, of the bewitched, and
    not of the witches. For they can trans/forme<span class="snp" id="p_94"><i>94.</i></span> themselves in everie part

    happened in the city of <i>Salamin</i>, in the kingdome of <i>Cyprus</i>
    (wherein is a good haven) that a ship loaden with merchandize staied
    there for a short space. In the meane time many of the souldiers and
    mariners went to shoare, to provide fresh victuals.<span class="sni">What
    the divel shuld the witch meane to make chois of the English man?</span> Among which number,
    a certaine English man, being a sturdie yoong fellowe, went to a womans
    house, a little waie out of the citie, and not farre from the sea
    side, to see whether she had anie egs to sell. Who perceiving him to
    be a lustie yoong fellowe, a stranger, and farre from his countrie (so
    as upon the losse of him there would be the lesse misse or inquirie)
    she considered with hir selfe how to destroie him; and willed him to
    staie there awhile, whilest she went to fetch a few egs for him. But
    she tarried long, so as the yoong man called unto hir, desiring hir to
    make hast: for he told hir that the tide would be spent, and by that
    meanes his ship would be gone, and leave him behind. Howbeit, after
    some detracting of time, she brought him a few egs, willing him to
    returne to hir, if his ship were gone when he came. The young fel/lowe<span class="snp" id="p_95"><i>95.</i></span>
    returned towards his ship: but before he went aboord, hee would needs
    eate an eg or twaine to satisfie his hunger, and<span class="sni">A strange
    metamorphôsis, of bodie, but not of mind.</span> within short space he
    became dumb and out of his wits (as he afterwards said.) When he would
    have entred into the ship, the mariners beat him backe with a cudgell,
    saieng; What a murren lacks the asse? Whi/ther<span class="snp"><b>73.</b></span> the divell will this
    asse? The asse or yoong man (I cannot tell by which name I should terme
    him) being many times repelled, and understanding their words that
    called him asse, considering that he could speake never a word, and yet
    could understand everie bodie; he thought that he was bewitched by the
    woman, at whose house he was. And therefore, when by no meanes he could
    get into the boate, but was driven to tarrie and see hir departure;
    being also beaten from place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
    to place, as an asse: he remembred the
    witches words, and the words of his owne fellowes that called him asse,
    and returned to the witches house, in whose service hee remained by the
    space of three yeares, dooing nothing with his hands all that while,
    but carried such burthens as she laied on his backe; having onelie this
    comfort, that although he were reputed an asse among strangers and
    beasts, yet that both this witch, and all other witches knew him to be
    a man.</p>

  <p>After three yeares were passed over, in a morning betimes he went to
    towne before his dame; who upon some occasion (of like to make water)
    staied a little behind. In the meane time being neere to a church,
    he heard a<span class="sni">Note the devotion of the asse.</span>
    little saccaring bell ring to the elevation of a morrowe
    masse, and not daring to go into the church, least he should have beene
    beaten and driven out with cudgels, in great devotion he fell downe in
    the churchyard, upon the knees of his hinder legs, and did lift his
    forefeet over his head, as the preest doth hold the sacrament at the
    elevation. Which prodigious sight when certeine merchants of <i>Genua</i>
    espied, and with woonder beheld; anon commeth the witch with a cudgell
    in hir hand, beating foorth the asse. And bicause (as it hath beene
    said) such kinds of witchcrafts are verie usuall in those parts; the
    merchants aforesaid made such meanes, as both the asse and the witch
    were attached by the judge. And she being examined and set upon the
    racke, confessed the whole matter, and promised, that if she might
    have libertie to go home, she would restore him to his old/<span class="snp" id="p_96"><i>96.</i></span> shape:
    and being dismissed, she did accordinglie. So as notwithstanding they
    apprehended hir againe, and burned hir: and the yoong man returned into
    his countrie with a joifull and merrie hart.</p>

  <p>Upon the advantage of this storie<span class="sni"><i>August lib. 18. de

    of the witchmongers triumph; and speciallie bicause S. <i>Augustine</i>
    subscribeth thereunto; or at the least to the verie like. Which I
    must confesse I find too common in his books, insomuch as I judge
    them rather to be foisted in by some fond papist or witchmonger,
    than so learned a mans dooings. The best is, that he himselfe is no
    eiewitnesse to any of those his tales; but speaketh onelie by report;
    wherein he uttereth these words: to wit, that It were a point of great
    incivilitie, &amp;c: to discredit so manie and so certeine reports. And in
    that respect he justifieth the corporall transfigurations of <i>Ulysses</i>
    his mates, throgh the witchcraft of <i>Circes</i>: and that foolish fable
    of <i>Præstantius</i> his father, who (he saith) did eate provender and
    haie <span class="sni">At the alps in Arcadia.</span>among
    other horsses, being himselfe turned into an horsse. Yea
    he verifieth the starkest lie that ever was invented, of the two
    alewives that used to transforme all their ghests into horsses, and
    to sell them awaie at markets and faires. And therefore I saie with
    <i>Cardanus</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
    that how much <i>Augustin</i> saith he hath seen with his eies,
    so much I am/<span class="snp"><b>74.</b></span> content to beleeve. Howbeit S. <i>Augustin</i><span class="sni"><i>Card.
    de Var. rerum. lib. 15 cap. 80.<br />August. Lib. 18. de civit. Dei.</i></span> concludeth
    against <i>Bodin</i>. For he affirmeth these transubstantiations to be but
    fantasticall, and that they are not according to the veritie, but
    according to the appearance. And yet I cannot allow of such appearances
    made by witches, or yet by divels: for I find no such power given by
    God to any creature. And I would wit of S. <i>Augustine</i>, where they
    became, whom <i>Bodins</i> transformed woolves devoured. But</p>

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_c.png" width="75" height="75" alt='C' /></span>ONCERNING
    the veritie or probabilitie of this enterlude, betwixt
    <i>Bodin</i>, <i>M. Mal.</i> the witch, the asse, the masse, the merchants, the
    inquisitors, the tormentors, &amp;c: First I woonder at the miracle of
    transubstantiation: Secondlie at the impudencie of <i>Bodin</i> and <i>James
    Sprenger</i>, for affirming so grosse a lie, devised beelike by the knight
    of the <i>Rhodes</i>, to make a foole of <i>Sprenger</i>, and an asse of <i>Bodin</i>:
    Thirdlie, that the asse had no more wit than to kneele downe and hold
    up his forefeete to a peece of starch or flowre, which neither would,
    nor could, nor did helpe him: Fourthlie, that the masse could not
    reforme that which the witch transformed: Fiftlie, that the merchants,
    the inquisitors, and the tormentors, could not either severallie or
    jointlie doo it, but referre the matter to the witches courtesie and
    good pleasure.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

  <p>But where was the yoong mans owne shape<span class="sni">His shape was
    in the woods: where else should it be?</span> all these three yeares, wherein
    he was made an asse? It is a certeine and a generall rule, that two
    substantiall formes cannot be in one subject <i>Simul &amp; semel</i>, both
    at once: which is confessed by themselves. The/<span class="snp" id="p_98"><i>98.</i></span> forme of the beast
    occupied some/<span class="snp"><b>75.</b></span> place in the aire, and so I thinke should the forme of
    a man doo also.<span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef. par. 1. quæ. 2.</i></span> For to bring the bodie of a man, without feeling, into
    such a thin airie nature, as that it can neither be seene nor felt,
    it may well be unlikelie, but it is verie impossible: for the aire is
    inconstant, and continueth not in one place. So as this airie creature
    would soone be carried into another region: as else-where I have
    largelie prooved.<span class="sni">In my discourse of spirits and divels, being the 17 booke of
    this volume.</span> But indeed our bodies are visible, sensitive, and
    passive, and are indued with manie other excellent properties, which
    all the divels in hell are not able to alter: neither can one haire of
    our head perish, or fall awaie, or be transformed, without the speciall
    providence of God almightie.</p>

  <p>But to proceed unto the probabilitie of this storie. What lucke was it,
    that this yoong fellow of <i>England</i>, landing so latelie in those parts,
    and that old woman of <i>Cyprus</i>, being both of so base a condition,
    should both understand one anothers communication; <i>England</i> and
    <i>Cyprus</i> being so manie hundred miles distant, and their languages so
    farre differing? I am sure in these daies, wherein trafficke is more
    used, and learning in more price; few yong or old mariners in this
    realme can either speake or understand the language spoken at <i>Salamin</i>
    in <i>Cyprus</i>, which is a kind of <i>Greeke</i>; and as few old women there
    can speake our language. But <i>Bodin</i> will saie; You heare, that at
    the inquisitors commandement, and through the tormentors correction,
    she promised to restore him to his owne shape: and so she did, as
    being thereunto compelled. I answer, that as the whole storie is an
    impious fable; so this assertion is false, and disagreeable to their
    owne doctrine, which mainteineth, that the witch dooth nothing but by
    the permission and leave of God. For if she could doo or undoo such a
    thing at hir owne pleasure, or at the commandement of the inquisitors,
    or for feare of the tormentors, or for love of the partie, or for
    remorse of conscience: then is it not either by the extraordinarie
    leave, nor yet by the like direction of God; except you will make him
    a confederate with old witches. I for my part woonder most, how they
    can turne and tosse a mans bodie so, and make it smaller and greater,
    to wit, like a mowse, or like an asse, &amp;c: and the man all this while
    to feele no paine. And I am not alone in this maze: for <span class="sni"><i>Dan. in dialog. cap. 3.</i></span><i>Danæus</i> a
    special mainteiner of their fol/lies<span class="snp" id="p_99"><i>99.</i></span> saith, that although <i>Augustine</i>
    and <i>Apuleius</i><span class="sni"><i>August. lib. de civit. Dei. cap. 17. 18.</i></span>
    doo write verie crediblie of these matters; yet will he
    never beleeve, that witches can change men into other formes; as asses,
    apes, woolves, beares, mice, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

  <h3>The fift Chapter.</h3>

  <p class="subhead"><i>That the bodie of a man cannot be turned into the bodie of a
    beast by a witch, is prooved by strong reasons, scriptures, and authorities.</i></p>

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_b.png" width="75" height="75" alt='B' /></span>UT
    was this man an asse all this while? Or was this asse a
    man? <i>Bodin</i> saith (his reason onelie reserved) he was trulie
    transubstantiated into an asse; so as there must be no part of a man,
    but reason remaining in this asse. And yet <i>Hermes Trismegistus</i>
    <span class="sni"><i>Hermes Trismeg in suo Periandro.</i></span>
    thinketh he hath good authoritie and reason to saie; <i>Aliud corpus
    quàm humanum non capere animam humanam; nec/ fas<span class="snp"><b>76.</b></span> esse in corpus animæ
    ratione carentis animam rationalem corruere</i>; that is; An humane
    soule cannot receive anie other than an humane bodie, nor yet canne
    light into a bodie that wanteth reason of mind. But S. <i>James</i><span class="sni">Jam. 2, 26.</span> saith;
    the bodie without the spirit is dead. And surelie, when the soule is
    departed from the bodie, the life of man is dissolved: and therefore
    <i>Paule</i><span class="sni">Phili. 1, 23.</span> wished to be dissolved, when he would have beene with Christ.
    The bodie of man is subject to divers kinds of agues, sicknesses, and
    infirmities, whereunto an asses bodie is not inclined: and mans bodie
    must be fed with bread, &amp;c: and not with hay. <i>Bodins</i> asseheaded man
    must either eate haie, or nothing: as appeareth in the storie. Mans
    bodie also is subject unto death, and hath his daies numbred. If this
    fellowe had died in the meane time, as his houre might have beene
    come, for anie thing the divels, the witch, or <i>Bodin</i> knew; I mervell
    then what would have become of this asse, or how the witch could have
    restored him to shape, or whether he should have risen at the daie of
    judgement in an asses bodie and shape. For <i>Paule</i><span class="sni">1. Cor. 15. 44.</span> saith, that that
    verie bodie which is sowne and buried a naturall bodie, is raised/<span class="snp" id="p_100"><i>100.</i></span> a
    spirituall bodie. The life of Jesus is made manifest in our mortall
    flesh, and not in the flesh of an asse.</p>

  <p>God hath endued everie man and everie thing with his proper nature,
    substance, forme, qualities, and gifts, and directeth their waies. As
    for the waies of an asse, he taketh no such care: howbeit, they have
    also their properties and substance severall to themselves. For there
    is one flesh (saith <i>Paule</i>)<span class="sni">1. Cor. 15, 39.</span> of men, another flesh of beasts, another
    of fishes, another of birds. And therefore it is absolutelie against
    the ordinance of God (who hath made me a man) that I should flie like a
    bird, or swim like a fish, or creepe like a worme, or become an asse in
    shape: insomuch as if God would give me leave, I cannot doo it; for it
    were contrarie to his owne order and decree, and to the constitution of
    anie bodie which he hath made.<span class="sni">Psal. 119.</span> Yea the spirits themselves
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>have their
    lawes and limits prescribed, beyond the which they cannot passe one
    haires breadth; otherwise God should be contrarie to himselfe: which is
    farre from him. Neither is Gods omnipotencie hereby qualified, but the
    divels impotencie manifested, who hath none other power, but that which
    God from the beginning hath appointed unto him, consonant to his nature
    and substance. He may well be restreined from his power and will, but
    beyond the same he cannot passe, as being Gods minister, no further but
    in that which he hath from the beginning enabled him to doo: which is,
    that he being a spirit, may with Gods leave and ordinance viciat and
    corrupt the spirit and will of man: wherein he is verie diligent.</p>

  <p>What a beastlie assertion is it, that a man, whom GOD hath made
    according to his owne similitude and likenes, should be by a witch
    turned into a beast? What an impietie is it to affirme, that an asses

    under his feete, all sheepe and oxen, yea woolves, asses, and all other
    beasts of the field, the foules of the aire, the fishes of the sea,

    as appeareth both by the plaine words of the text,<span class="sni">Dan. 4.</span> and also by the
    opinions of the best interpretors thereof: but that he was, for his
    beastlie government and conditions, throwne out of his kingdome and
    banished for a time, and driven to hide himselfe in the wildernesse,
    there in exile to lead his life in beastlie sort, among beasts of the
    field, and fowles of the aire (for by the waie I tell you it appeareth
    by the text, that he was rather turned into the shape of a fowle than
    of a beast) untill he rejecting his beastlie conditions, was upon his
    repentance and amendment called home, and restored unto his kingdome.
    Howbeit, this (by their confession) was neither divels nor witches
    dooing; but a miracle wrought by God, whom alone I acknowledge to be
    able to bring to passe such workes at his pleasure. Wherein I would
    know what our witchmongers have gained./<span class="snp"><b>78.</b></span></p>

  <p>I am not ignorant that some write, that after the death of
    <span class="sni"><i>Cor. Agrip. de vanit. scient. cap. 44.</i></span>
    <i>Nabuchadnez-zar</i>, his sonne *<i>Eilumorodath</i><span class="sni">[* tr. of <i>Euil</i>]</span> gave his bodie to the

    which these witchmongers doo so rave and rage upon, is (as all the
    learned sort of physicians affirme) a disease proceeding partlie from
    melancholie, wherebie manie suppose themselves to be woolves, or such

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_f.png" width="75" height="75" alt='F' /></span>OR
    the maintenance of witches transportations, they object the words
    of the Gospell,<span class="sni">Matth. 4, 8.<br />Luk. 3, 9.</span> where the divell is said to take up Christ, and to
    set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and on a mountaine, &amp;c. Which
    if he had doone in maner and forme as they suppose, it followeth not
    therefore that witches could doo the like; nor yet that the divell
    would doo it for them at their pleasure; for they know not their
    thoughts, neither can otherwise communicate with them. But I answer,
    <span class="sni">Answer to the former objection.</span>
    that if it were so grosselie to be understood, as they imagine it,
    yet should it make nothing to their purpose. For I hope they will not
    saie, that Christ had made anie ointments, or entred into anie league
    with the divell, and by vertue thereof was transported from out of the
    wildernes, unto the top of the temple of Jerusalem; or that the divell
    could have maisteries over his bodie, whose soule he could never laie
    hold upon; especiallie when he might (with a becke of his finger)
    have called unto him, and have had the assistance of manie legions of
    angels.<span class="sni">Matt. 26, 53.</span> Neither (as I thinke) will they presume to make Christ partaker
    of the divels purpose and sinne in that behalfe. If they saie; This
    was an action wrought by the speciall providence of God, and by his
    appointment, that the scripture might be fulfilled: then what gaine
    our witchmongers by this place? First, for that they maie not produce
    a particular example to prove so generall an argument. And againe, if
    it were by Gods speciall providence and appointment; then why should
    it not be doone by the hand of God, as it was in the storie of <i>Job</i>?
    Or if it were Gods speciall purpose and pleasure,<span class="sni">Job. 1, 11.<br />Job. 2, 5.</span> that there should be
    so extraordinarie a matter brought to passe by the hand of the divell;
    could not God have given to the wicked angell extraordinarie power, and
    cloathed him with extraordinarie shape; where/by<span class="snp" id="p_104"><i>104.</i></span> he might be made an
    instrument able to accomplish that matter, as he did to his angell that
    carried <i>Abacuck</i> to <i>Daniell</i>, and to them that he sent to destroie
    <i>Sodome</i>? But you shall understand, that/<span class="snp"><b>79.</b></span> this was doone in a vision,
    and not in veritie of action. So as they have a verie cold pull of this
    place, which is the speciall peece of scripture alledged of them for
    their transportations.</p>

  <p>Heare therefore what <i>Calvine</i><span class="sni"><i>J. Calvine in
    harmon. Evang. in Matth. 4. &amp; Luk. 4.</i></span> saith in his commentarie upon that
    place, in these words; The question is, whether Christ were carried
    aloft indeed, or whether it were but in a vision? Manie affirme verie
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
    obstinatlie, that his bodie was trulie and reallie as they saie taken
    up: bicause they thinke it too great an indignitie for Christ to be
    made subject to sathans illusions. But this objection is easilie washed
    awaie. For it is no absurditie to grant all this to be wrought through
    Gods permission, or Christes voluntarie subjection: so long as we yeeld
    not to thinke that he suffered these temptations inwardlie, that is to
    saie, in mind or soule. And that which is afterwards set downe by the
    Evangelist, where the divell shewed him all the kingdoms of the world,
    and the glorie of the same, and that to be doone (as it is said in
    <i>Luke</i>) in the twinkling of an eie, dooth more agree with a vision than
    with a reall action. So farre are the verie words of <i>Calvine</i>. Which
    differ not one syllable nor five words from that which I had written
    herein, before I looked for his opinion in the matter. And this I hope
    will be sufficient to overthrow the assertions of them that laie the
    ground of their transportations and flieng in the aire hereupon.</p>

  <p>He that will saie, that these words; to wit, that Christ was taken up,
    &amp;c: can hardlie be applied to a vision, let him turne to the prophesie
    of <i>Ezechiell</i>,<span class="sni">Ezec. 3, 12. and 14.</span> and see the selfe-same words used in a vision: saving
    that where Christ is said to be taken up by the divell, <i>Ezechiell</i>
    is taken up, and lifted up, and carried by the spirit of God, and yet
    in a vision. But they have lesse reason that build upon this sandie
    rocke, the supernaturall frame of transubstantiation; as almost all
    our witching writers doo. For <i>Sprenger</i> &amp; <i>Institor</i><span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef.</i></span> saie, that the
    divell in the likenesse of a falcon caught him up. <i>Danæus</i> saith, it
    was in the similitude of a man; others saie, of an angell painted with
    wings; others, invisiblie: <i>Ergo</i> the di/vell<span class="snp" id="p_105"><i>105.</i></span> can take (saie they) what
    shape he list. But though some may cavill upon the divels transforming
    of himselfe; yet, that either divell or witch can transforme or
    transubstantiat others, there is no tittle nor colour in the scriptures
    to helpe them. If there were authoritie for it, and that it were past
    all peradventure, lo, what an easie matter it is to resubstantiate an
    asse into a man. For <i>Bodin</i> saith upon the word of <i>Apuleius</i>,
    <span class="sni"><i>J. Bod. lib. de dæm. 3. cap. 5.</i></span> that if
    the asse
    eate new roses, anise, or baie leaves out of spring water, it
    will presentlie returne him into a man. Which thing
    <i>Sprenger</i><span class="sni"><i>In Mal. mal.</i></span> saith maie be doone, by washing the
    asse in faire water: yea he sheweth an
    instance, where, by drinking of
    water an asse was turned
    into a man.</p>

    saie he were bewitched, as <i>Job</i> never saith? <sup>a</sup>For<span class="sni"><sup>a</sup> Job. 1, 14.</span> first there came
    a messenger unto him, and said; Thy oxen were plowing, and thy asses
    were feeding in their places, <sup>b</sup>and<span class="sni"><sup>b</sup> verse, 15.</span> the <i>Sabeans</i> came violentlie

    from the sole of his foote to the crowne of his head. If anie man in
    these daies called <i>Job</i> should be by the appointment or hand of God
    thus handled, as this <i>Job</i> was; I warrant you that all the old women
    in the countrie would be called <i>Coram nobis</i>: warrants would be sent
    out on everie side, publike and private inquirie made what old women
    latelie resorted to <i>Jobs</i> house, or to anie of those places, where
    these misfortunes fell. If anie poore old woman had chanced within two
    or three moneths to have borrowed a curtsie of *seasing,<span class="sni">[* ? searsing]</span> or to have
    fetcht from thence a pot of milke, or had she required some almes,
    and not obteined it at <i>Jobs</i> hand; there had beene argument enough
    to have brought hir to confusion: and to be more certeine to have the
    right witch apprehended, figures must have beene cast, the sive and
    sheares must have beene set on worke; yea rather than the witch should
    escape, a conjuror must have earned a little monie, a circle must have
    beene made, and a divell raised to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
    tell the truth: mother <i>Bungie</i>
    must have been gon unto, and after she had learned hir name, whom <i>Job</i>
    most suspected, she would have confirmed the suspicion with artificiall
    accusations: in the end, some woman or other must have beene hanged for
    it. But as <i>Job</i> said; <i>Dominus dedit</i>: so said he not; <i>Diabolus vel
    Lamia sed Dominus abstulit</i>. Which agreeth with the tenor of the text,
    where it is written, that the divell at everie of <i>Jobs</i> afflictions
    desired God to laie his hand upon him. Insomuch as <i>Job</i><span class="sni"><i>J. Calvin. in Job. cap. 1. 21.</i></span> imputed no
    part of his calamitie unto divels, witches, nor yet unto conjurors, or
    their inchantments; as we have learned now to doo. Neither sinned he,
    or did God any wrong, when he laid it to his charge: but we dishonour
    God greatlie, when we attribute either the power or proprietie of God
    the creator unto a creature.</p>

  <p>*<i>Calvine</i><span class="sni"><i>J. Calvin. in<br />Job, cap. 2.<br />Sermon. 8.<br />Muscul. in loc.
      comm.<br />Idem, ibidem.</i></span> saith; We derogate much from Gods glorie and
    omnipotencie, when we saie he dooth but give sathan leave to doo it:
    which is (saith he) to mocke Gods justice; and so fond an asser/tion,<span class="snp" id="p_107"><i>107.</i></span>
    that if asses could speake, they would speake more wiselie than so. For
    a temporall judge saith not to/<span class="snp"><b>81.</b></span> the hangman; I give thee leave to hang
    this offender, but commandeth him to doo it. But the mainteiners of
    witches omnipotencie, saie; Doo you not see how reallie and palpablie
    the divell tempted and plagued <i>Job</i>? I answer first, that there is
    no corporall or visible divell named nor seene in any part of that
    circumstance; secondlie, that it was the hand of God that did it;
    thirdlie, that as there is no communitie betweene the person of a
    witch, and the person of a divell, so was there not any conference or
    practise betwixt them in this case.</p>

  <p>And as touching the communication betwixt God and the divell,<span class="sni"><i>J.
    Calvine in his sermon upon Job.</i></span> behold
    what <i>Calvine</i> saith, writing or rather preaching of purpose upon that
    place, wherupon they thinke they have so great advantage; When sathan
    is said to appeere before God, it is not doone in some place certeine,
    but the scripture speaketh so to applie it selfe to our rudenes.
    Certeinlie the divell in this and such like cases is an instrument to
    worke Gods will, and not his owne: and therefore it is an ignorant
    and an ungodlie saieng (as <i>Calvine</i> judgeth it) to affirme, that God
    dooth but permit and suffer the divell. For if sathan were so at his
    owne libertie (saith he) we should be overwhelmed at a sudden. And
    doubtlesse, if he had power to hurt the bodie, there were no waie
    to resist: for he would come invisiblie upon us, and knocke us on
    the heads; yea hee would watch the best and dispatch them, whilest
    they were about some wicked act. If they saie; God commandeth him,
    no bodie impugneth them: but that God should give him leave, I saie
    with <i>Calvine</i>, that the divell is not in such favour with God, as to
    obteine any such request at his hands.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

  <p>And wheras by our witchmongers opinions and arguments, the witch
    procureth the divell, and the divell asketh leave of God to plague whom
    the witch is disposed: there is not (as I have said) any such corporall
    communication betweene the divell and a witch, as witchmongers imagine.
    <span class="sni"><i>J. Calvine in Job. cap. 1. sermon. 5.</i></span>
    Neither is God mooved at all at sathans sute, who hath no such favour
    or grace with him, as to obteine any thing at his hands.</p>

  <p>But <i>M. Mal.</i><span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef. pa. 1. quæst. 1.<br />Idem part. 1. quæst. 4.</i></span> and his friends denie, that there were any witches in
    <i>Jobs</i> time: yea the witchmongers are content to saie, that/<span class="snp" id="p_108"><i>108.</i></span> there were
    none found to exercise this art in Christs time, from his birth to his
    death, even by the space of thirtie three yeares. If there had beene
    anie (saie they)<span class="sni">Note what is said touching the booke of Job.</span> they should have beene there spoken of. As touching
    the authoritie of the booke of <i>Job</i>, there is no question but that it
    is verie canonicall and authentike. Howbeit, manie writers, both of the
    Jewes and others, are of opinion, that <i>Moses</i> was the author of this
    booke; and that he did set it as a looking glasse before the people: to
    the intent the children of <i>Abraham</i> (of whose race he himselfe came)
    might knowe, that God shewed favour to others that were not of the same
    line, and be ashamed of their wickednesse: seeing an uncircumcised
    Painime had so well demeaned himselfe. Upon which argument <i>Calvine</i>
    (though he had written upon the same) saith, that Forsomuch as it is
    uncerteine, whether it were <i>Res gesta</i> or <i>Exempli gratia</i>, we must
    leave it in suspense. Nevertheles (saith he) let us take that which is
    out of all doubt; namelie, that the Holy-ghost hath indited the booke,
    to the end that the Jewes should knowe that God hath had a people
    alwaies to serve him throughout the world, even of such as were no/<span class="snp"><b>82.</b></span>
    Jewes, nor segregated from other nations.</p>

  <p>Howbeit, I for my part denie not the veritie of the storie; though
    indeed I must confesse, that I thinke there was no such corporall
    enterlude betweene God, the divell, and <i>Job</i>, as they imagine: neither
    anie such reall presence and communication as the witchmongers conceive
    and mainteine; who are so grosse herein, that they doo not onlie
    beleeve, but publish so palpable absurdities concerning such reall
    actions betwixt the divell and man, as a wise man would be ashamed to
    read, but much more to credit: as that S. <i>Dunstan</i><span class="sni"><i>In legenda aurea.</i></span> lead the divell
    about the house by the nose with a paire of pinsors or tongs, and made
    him rore so lowd, as the place roong thereof, &amp;c: with a thousand the
    like fables, without which neither the art of poperie nor of witchcraft
    could stand. But you may see more of this matter else-where, where in
    few words (which I thought good here to omit, least I should seeme to
    use too manie repetitions) I answer effectuallie to their cavils about

    great efficacie.</p>

  <p>These are all couseners and abusers of the people in their severall
    kinds. But bicause they are all termed of our translators by the name
    of witches in the Bible: therefore the lies of <i>M. Mal.</i> and <i>Bodin</i>,
    and all our old wives tales are applied unto these names, and easilie
    beleeved of the common people, who have never hitherto beene instructed
    in the understanding of these words. In which respect, I will (by Gods
    grace) shew you (concerning the signification of them) the opinion
    of the most learned in our age; speciallie of <i>Johannes Wierus</i>; who
    though hee himselfe were singularlie learned in the toongs, yet for his
    satisfaction and full resolution in the same, he sent for the judgement
    of <i>Andræas Massius</i>,<span class="sni">[or <i>Masius</i>]</span> the most famous <i>Hebrician</i> in the world, and
    had it in such sense and order, as I meane to set downe unto you. And
    yet I give you this note<span class="sni">Note.</span> by the waie, that witchcraft or inchantment
    is diverslie taken in the scriptures; somtimes nothing tending to such
    end as it is commonlie thought to doo. For in 1 <i>Sa/muell</i>,<span class="snp" id="p_110"><i>110.</i></span>
    <span class="sni">1. Sa. 15, 23.</span> 15, 23.
    it is all one with rebellion. <i>Jesabell</i> for hir idolatrous life/<span class="snp"><b>83.</b></span> is
    called a witch. Also in the new testament, even S. <i>Paule</i> saith the
    <i>Galathians</i><span class="sni">2. Re. 9, 22.<br />Gal. 3, 1.</span> are bewitched, bicause they were seduced and lead from the
    true understanding of the scriptures.</p>

  <p>Item<span class="sni">Matth. 2, 1.</span> sometimes it is taken in good part; as the magicians that came
    to worship and offer to Christ: and also where <i>Daniell</i><span class="sni">Daniel. 4.</span> is said to
    be an inchanter, yea a principall inchanter: which title being given
    him in divers places of that storie, he never seemeth to refuse or
    dislike;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
    but rather intreateth for the pardon and qualification of the
    rigor towards other inchanters, which were meere couseners indeed: as
    appeareth in the second chapter of <i>Daniell</i>,<span class="sni">Dan. 2, 8.</span> where you may see that
    the king espied their fetches.</p>

  <p>Sometimes such are called conjurors,<span class="sni">Actes. 19.</span> as being but roges, and lewd
    people, would use the name of Jesus to worke miracles, whereby, though
    they being faithlesse could worke nothing; yet is their practise
    condemned by the name of conjuration.<span class="sni">Gen. 4, 18.<br />Exod. 7, 13, &amp;c.<br />Acts 13.<br />Exod. 22, &amp;c.<br />
    Acts. 13.<br />Acts. 19.<br />Canticles of Salomon. cap. 4. verse. 9.</span> Sometimes jugglers are called
    witches. Sometimes also they are called sorcerers, that impugne
    the gospell of Christ, and seduce others with violent persuasions.
    Sometimes a murtherer with poison is called a witch. Sometimes they are
    so termed by the verie signification of their names; as <i>Elimas</i>, which
    signifieth a sorcerer. Sometimes bicause they studie curious and vaine
    arts. Sometimes it is taken for woonding or greeving of the hart. Yea
    the verie word <i>Magus</i>, which is Latine for a magician, is translated
    a witch; and yet it was hertofore alwaies taken in the good part. And
    at this daie it is indifferent to saie in the English toong; She is a
    witch; or, She is a wise woman.</p>

  <p>Sometimes observers of dreames, sometimes soothsaiers, sometimes the
    observers of the flieng of foules,<span class="sni">Deut. 18, 2.<br />Jerem. 27.<br />Acts. 8.</span>
    of the meeting of todes, the falling
    of salt, &amp;c: are called witches. Sometimes he or she is called a witch,
    that take upon them either for gaine or glorie, to doo miracles; and
    yet can doo nothing. Sometimes they are called witches in common
    speech, that are old, lame, curst, or melancholike, as a nickname. But
    as for our old women, that are said to hurt children with their eies,
    or lambs with their lookes, or that pull downe the moone out of heaven,
    or make so foolish a bargaine, or doo such homage to the divell; you
    shall not read in the bible of any such witches, or of any such actions
    imputed to them.//</p>

  <p class="subhead"><i>The exposition of this Hebrue word Chasaph, wherein is
    answered the objection conteined in Exodus 22. to wit: Thou
    shalt not suffer a witch to live, and of Simon Magus. Acts. 8.</i></p>

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_c.png" width="75" height="75" alt='C' /></span>HASAPH,
    being an Hebrue word, is Latined <i>Veneficium</i>, and is in
    English, poisoning, or witchcraft; if you will so have it. The Hebrue
    sentence written in <i>Exodus</i>, 22. is by the 70. interpretors translated
    thus into Greeke, Φαρμακοῦς οὐκ ἐπιζεώσετε, which in Latine is,
    <i>Veneficos (sive) veneficas non retinebitis in vita</i>, in English, You
    shall not suffer anie poisoners, or (as it is translated) witches to
    live. The which sentence <i>Josephus</i><span class="sni"><i>Joseph. in
    Judæorum antiquitat.</i></span> an Hebrue borne, and a man of great
    estimation, learning and fame, interpreteth in this wise; Let none of
    the children of Israel have any poison that is deadlie, or prepared
    to anie hurtfull use. If anie be apprehended with such stuffe, let
    him be put to death, and suffer that which he ment to doo to them,
    for whom he prepared it. The <i>Rabbins</i> exposition agree heerewithall.
    <i>Lex Cornelia</i> differeth not from this sense, to wit, that he must
    suffer death, which either maketh, selleth, or hath anie poison, to the
    intent to kill anie man. This word is found in these places following:
    <i>Exodus.</i> 22, 18. <i>Deut.</i> 18, 10. 2. <i>Sam.</i> 9, 22. <i>Dan.</i> 2, 2. <i>2.
    Chr.</i> 33, 6. <i>Esay.</i> 47, 9, 12. <i>Malach</i>, 3, 5. <i>Jerem.</i> 27, 9. <i>Mich.</i>
    5, 2. <i>Nah.</i> 3, 4. <i>bis</i>. Howbeit, in all our English/<span class="snp" id="p_112"><i>112.</i></span> translations,
    <i>Chasaph</i> is translated, witchcraft.</p>

  <p>And bicause I will avoid prolixitie and contention both at once, I
    will admit that <i>Veneficæ</i> were such witches, as with their poisons
    did much hurt among the children of Israell; and I will not denie that
    there remaine such untill this daie, bewitching men, and making them
    beleeve, that by vertue of words, and certeine ceremonies, they bring
    to passe such mischeefes, and intoxications, as they indeed accomplish
    by poisons. And this abuse in cousenage of people, together with the
    taking of Gods name in vaine, in manie places of the scripture is
    reprooved, especiallie by the name of witchcraft, even where no poisons
    are. According to the sense which S. <i>Paule</i> useth to the <i>Galathians</i><span class="sni">Gal. 3, 1.</span>
    in these words, where he sheweth plainelie, that the true signification
    of witchcraft is cousenage; O ye foolish <i>Galathians</i>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span> (saith he) who
    hath bewitched you? to wit, cousened or abused you, making you beleeve
    a thing which is neither so nor so. Whereby he meaneth not to aske of
    them, who have with charmes, &amp;c: or with poisons deprived them of their
    health, life, cattell, or children, &amp;c: but who hath abused or cousened
    them, to make them beleeve lies. This phrase is also used by <i>Job.</i><span class="sni">Job. 15, 12.</span>
    15. But that we may be throughlie resolved of the true meaning of this
    phrase used by <i>Paule</i>, <i>Gal.</i> 3. let us examine the description of a
    notable witch called <i>Simon Magus</i>, made by S. <i>Luke</i>;<span class="sni">Acts. 8, 9.</span> There was (saith
    he) in the citie of <i>Samaria</i>, a certeine man called <i>Simon</i>,/<span class="snp"><b>85.</b></span> which
    used witchcraft, and bewitched the people of <i>Samaria</i>, saieng that
    he himself was some great man. I demand, in what other thing here do
    we see anie witchcraft, than that he abused the people, making them
    beleeve he could worke miracles, whereas in truth he could doo no such
    thing; as manifestlie may appeare in the 13. and 19. verses of the same
    chapter: where he wondered at the miracles wrought by the apostles, and
    would have purchased with monie the power of the Holy-ghost to worke
    wonders.</p>

  <p>It will be said,<span class="sni">Acts. 8, 11.</span> the people had reason to beleeve him, bicause it is
    written, that he of long time had bewitched them with sorceries. But
    let the bewitched <i>Galathians</i> be a warning both to the bewitched
    <i>Samaritans</i>, and to all other that are cousened or bewitched through
    false doctrine, or legierdemaine; least while they attend to such
    fables and lies, they be brought into ignorance,/<span class="snp" id="p_113"><i>113.</i></span> and so in time be
    led with them awaie from God. And finallie, let us all abandon such
    witches and couseners, as with <i>Simon Magus</i> set themselves in the
    place of God, boasting that they can doo miracles, expound dreames,
    foretell things to come, raise the dead, &amp;c: which are the workes of
    the Holy-ghost,<span class="sni">1. Reg. 8, 39.<br />Matth. 9. 4. 12. 25. 22.<br />Acts. 1, 24. &amp; 15, 8.<br />
    Rom. 8, 27.<br />Mark. 2.<br />Luk. 6, 17. &amp; 11. &amp; 9.<br />Joh. 1 &amp; 2. &amp; 6. &amp; 13.<br />
    Apoc. 2. &amp; 3.<br />Luk. 11, 29.</span> who onlie searcheth the heart and reines, and onelie
    worketh great wonders, which are now staied and accomplished in Christ,
    in whome who so stedfastlie beleeveth shall not need to be by such
    meanes resolved or confirmed in his doctrine and gospell. And as for
    the unfaithfull, they shall have none other miracle shewed unto them,
    but the signe of <i>Jonas</i> the prophet.</p>

  <p>And therefore I saie, whatsoever they be that with <i>Simon Magus</i>
    take upon them to worke such wonders, by soothsaieng, sorcerie, or
    witchcraft, are but liers,<span class="sni">Eccl. 34, 5.</span> deceivers, and couseners, according to
    <i>Syrachs</i> saieng; Sorcerie, witchcraft, soothsaieng, and dreames, are
    but vanitie,<span class="sni">Eccl. 34, 8.</span> and the lawe shalbe fulfilled without such lies. God
    commanded the people, that they should not regard them that wrought
    with spirits,<span class="sni">Levi. 19, 31.</span> nor soothsaiers: for the estimation that was attributed
    unto them, offended God.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

  <h3>The second Chapter.</h3>

  <p class="subhead"><i>The place of Deuteronomie expounded, wherin are recited all
    kind of witches; also their opinions confuted, which hold
    that they can worke such miracles as are imputed unto them.</i></p>

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_t.png" width="75" height="75" alt='T' /></span>HE
    greatest and most common objection is, that if there were not
    some, which could worke such miraculous or supernaturall feats,<span class="sni">Deut. 18. 10. 11.</span> by
    themselves, or by their divels, it should not have beene said; Let
    none be found among you, that maketh his sonne or his daughter to go
    through the fier, or that useth witchcraft, or is a regarder of times,
    or a marker of the flieng of fowles, or a sorcerer, or a charmer, or
    that counselleth with spirits, or a soothsaier, or that asketh counsell
    of the dead, or (as some translate it)/<span class="snp" id="p_114"><i>114.</i></span> that raiseth the dead. But
    as there is no one place in the scripture that saith they can worke
    miracles, so it shalbe easie to proove, that these were all couseners,
    everie one abusing the people in his/ severall<span class="snp"><b>86.</b></span> kind; and are accurssed
    of God. Not that they can doo all such things indeed, as there is
    expressed; but for that they take upon them to be the mightie power of
    God, and to doo that which is the onelie worke of him, seducing the
    people, and blaspheming the name of God,<span class="sni">Esay. 42, 8.<br />Ps. 24. 8. 10.</span> who will not give his glorie
    to anie creature, being himselfe the king of glorie and omnipotencie.</p>

  <p>First I aske, what miracle was wrought by their passing through
    the fier? Trulie it cannot be prooved that anie effect followed;
    but that the people were bewitched, to suppose their sinnes to be
    purged thereby; as the <i>Spaniards</i> thinke of scourging and whipping
    themselves. So as Gods power was imputed to that action, and so
    forbidden as an idolatrous sorcerie. What woonders worketh the regarder
    of times? What other divell dealeth he withall, than with the spirit of
    superstition? Doth he not deceive himselfe and others, and therefore is
    worthilie condemned for a witch? What spirit useth he, which marketh
    the flieng of fowles? Nevertheles, he is here condemned as a practiser
    of witchcraft; bicause he couseneth the people, and taketh upon him
    to be a prophet; impiouslie referring Gods certeine ordinances to the
    flittering fethers and uncerteine waies of a bird. The like effects
    produceth sorcerie, charming, consultation with spirits, soothsaieng,
    and consulting with the dead: in everie of the which Gods power is
    obscured, his glorie defaced, and his commandement infringed.</p>

  <p>And to proove that these soothsaiers and witches are but lieng mates
    and couseners; note these words pronounced by God himselfe,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> even
    in the selfe same place to the children of Israell:<span class="sni">Deut. 18, 14</span> Although the
    Gentiles suffered themselves to be abused, so as they gave eare to
    these sorcerers, &amp;c: he would not suffer them so, but would raise them
    a prophet, who should speake the truth. As if he should saie; The
    other are but lieng and cousening mates, deceitfull and undermining
    merchants, whose abuses I will make knowne to my people. And that
    everie one maie be resolved herein, let the last sentence of this
    precept be well weighed; to wit, Let none be found among you, that
    asketh counsell of (or rai/seth<span class="snp" id="p_115"><i>115.</i></span> the dead.)</p>

  <p>First you know the soules<span class="sni">Sap. 3, 1.<br />Luk. 16, 23.</span> of the righteous are in the hands of God,
    and resting with <i>Lazarus</i> in <i>Abrahams</i> bosome, doo sleepe in Jesus
    Christ. And from that sleepe, man shall not be raised, till the heavens
    be no more: according to this of <i>David</i>:<span class="sni">Job. 14, 12.<br />
    Psal 88, 10.<br />Deut. 18, 11.<br />Luk. 16. 29. 31.</span> Wilt thou shew woonders among
    the dead? Nay, the Lord saith, The living shall not be taught by the
    dead, but by the living. As for the unrighteous, they are in hell,
    where is no redemption; neither is there anie passage from heaven to
    earth, but by God and his angels.<span class="sni">Luk. 16, 22.</span> As touching the resurrection and
    restauration of the bodie, read <i>John.</i> 5.<span class="sni">Joh. 5, 21.</span> and you shall manifestlie
    see, that it is the onelie worke of the father, who hath given the
    power therof to the sonne, and to none other, &amp;c. <i>Dominus percutit,
    &amp; ipse medetur: Ego occidam, &amp; ego vivefaciam.</i><span class="sni">Ose. 6.<br />
    Acts. 17. 25. 28.<br />Tim. 6, 13.</span> And in manie other
    places it is written, that God giveth life and beeing to all. Although
    <i>Plato</i>, with his maister <i>Socrates</i>, the cheefe pillers of these
    vanities, say, that one <i>Pamphilus</i> was called up out of hel, who
    when he cam among the people, told manie incredible tales concerning
    infernall actions. But herein I take up the proverbe;/<span class="snp"><b>87.</b></span> <i>Amicus Plato,
    amicus Socrates, sed major amica veritas</i>.</p>

  <p>So as this last precept, or last part thereof, extending to that which
    neither can be done by witch nor divell, maie well expound the other
    parts and points therof. For it is not ment hereby, that they can doo
    such things indeed; but that they make men beleeve they doo them, and
    thereby cousen the people, and take upon them the office of God, and
    therewithall also blaspheme his holie name, and take it in vaine; as by
    the words of charmes and conjurations doo appeare, which you shall see,
    if you looke into these words, <i>Habar</i> and <i>Idoni</i>.</p>

  <p>In like manner I saie you may see, that by the prohibition of
    divinations by augurie, and of soothsaiengs, &amp;c., who are witches, and
    can indeed doo nothing but lie and cousen the people, the lawe of God
    condemneth them not, for that they can worke miracles, but bicause they
    saie they can doo that which perteineth to God,<span class="sni"><i>26. quæ. 7. non. obser. fact. 1398. act. 17.<br />
    August. de spirit. &amp; anima. cap. 28.</i></span> and for cousenage, &amp;c.
    Concerning other points of witchcraft conteined therein, and bicause
    some cannot otherwise be satisfied, I will alledge under one sentence,
    the decretals, the mind of S. <i>Augustine</i>, the councell
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> <i>Aurelian</i>,
    and the determination of/<span class="snp" id="p_116"><i>116.</i></span> <i>Paris</i>, to wit: Who so observeth, or giveth
    heed unto soothsaiengs, divinations, witchcraft, &amp;c., or doth give
    credit to anie such, he renounceth christianitie, and shalbe counted
    a pagane, &amp; an enemie to God; yea and he erreth both in faith and
    philosophie. And the reason is therewithall expressed in the canon, to
    wit; Bicause hereby is attributed to a creature, that which perteineth
    to God onelie and alone. So as, under this one sentence (Thou shalt
    not suffer a poisoner or a witch to live) is forbidden both murther
    and witchcraft; the murther consisting in poison; the witchcraft in
    cousenage or blasphemie.</p>

  <h3>The third Chapter.</h3>

  <p class="subheadc"><i>That women have used poisoning in all ages more than men, and of the
    inconvenience of poisoning.</i></p>

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_a.png" width="75" height="75" alt='A' /></span>S
    women in all ages have beene counted most apt to conceive
    witchcraft, and the divels speciall instruments therin, and the onelie
    or cheefe practisers therof: so also it appeareth, that they have been
    the first inventers, and the greatest practisers of poisoning, and
    more naturallie addicted and given thereunto than men: according to
    the saieng of <i>Quintilian</i>; <i>Latrocinium faciliùs in viro, veneficium
    in fœmina credam</i>. From whom <i>Plinie</i><span class="sni"><i>Plin. lib.
    25. cap. 2.</i></span> differeth nothing in opinion,
    when he saith, <i>Scientiam fœminarum in veneficiis prævalere</i>. To be
    short, <i>Augustine</i>, <i>Livie</i>, <i>Valerius</i>, <i>Diodorus</i>, and manie other
    agree, that women were the first inventers and practisers of the art
    of poisoning. As for the rest of their cunning, in what estimation it
    was had, may appeare by these verses of <i>Horace</i>, wherein he doth not
    onelie declare the vanitie of witchcraft, but also expoundeth the other
    words, wherewithall we are now in hand.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="i0"><i>Somnia, terrores magicos, miracula, sagas,</i></div>

      <div class="i6"><i>Night-walking sprites, or Thessal bugs,</i></div>
      <div class="i8"><i>esteeme them not twoo rushes.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here <i>Horace</i> (you see) contemneth as ridiculous, all our witches
    cunning: marrie herein he comprehendeth not their poisoning art,
    which hereby he onelie seemed to thinke hurtfull. <i>Pythagoras</i> and
    <i>Democritus</i> give us the names of a great manie magicall hearbs and
    stones, whereof now, both the vertue, and the things themselves also
    are unknowne: as <i>Marmaritin</i>, whereby spirits might be raised:
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
    <i>Archimedon</i>, which would make one bewraie in his sleepe, all the
    secrets in his heart: <i>Adincantida</i>, <i>Calicia</i>, <i>Mevais</i>, <i>Chirocineta</i>, <i>&amp;c</i>:
    which had all their severall vertues, or rather poisons. But all these
    now are worne out of knowledge: marrie in their steed we have hogs turd
    and chervill, as the onelie thing whereby our witches worke miracles.</p>

  <p>Trulie this poisoning art called <i>Veneficium</i>, of all others is most
    abhominable; as whereby murthers maie be committed, where no suspicion
    maie be gathered, nor anie resistance can be made; the strong cannot
    avoid the weake, the wise cannot prevent the foolish, the godlie
    cannot be preserved from the hands of the wicked; children maie hereby
    kill their parents, the servant the maister, the wife hir husband, so
    privilie, so inevitablie, and so incurablie, that of all other it hath
    beene thought the most odious kind of murther; according to the saieng
    of <i>Ovid</i>:</p>

    40. <i>Veneficæ</i> or witches being of one confederacie, renewed a
    plague which was then almost ceased, besmeering with an ointment and
    a pouder, the posts and doores of mens houses; so as thereby whole
    families were poisoned: and of that stuffe they had prepared above
    40. crocks for that purpose. Herewithall they conveied inheritances
    as it pleased them, till at length they killed the brother and onelie
    sonne of one <i>Necus</i> (as lightlie none died in the house but the
    maisters and their children) which was much noted; and therewithall
    that one <i>Androgina</i> haunted the houses, speciallie of them that died:
    and she being suspected, apprehended, and examined, confessed the
    fact, conspiracie, and circumstance, as hath beene shewed. The like

    as of men: and that which is doone by poisons unto cattell, towards
    their destruction, is as commonlie attributed to witches charms as
    the other. And I doubt not, but some that would be thought cunning in

    it is written by divers authors, that if wolves doong be hidden in the
    mangers, racks, or else in the hedges about the pastures, where cattell
    go (through the antipathie of the nature of the woolfe and other

    is objected, that if <i>Veneficium</i> were comprehended under the
    title of manslaughter, it had beene a vaine repetition, and a
    disordered course undertaken by <i>Moses</i>, to set foorth a lawe against
    <i>Veneficas</i> severallie. But it might suffice to answer any reasonable
    christian, that such was the pleasure of the Holie-ghost, to institute
    a particular article herof, as of a thing more odious, wicked and
    dangerous, than any other kind of murther. But he that shall read the
    lawe of <i>Moses</i>, or the testament of Christ himselfe, shall find this
    kind of repetition and reiteration of the law most common. For as it is
    written <i>Exod.</i> 22, 21. Thou shalt not greeve nor afflict a stranger,
    for thou wast a stranger in the land of <i>Aegypt</i>:<span class="sni">Levit. 19, 33.</span> so are the same words
    found repeated in <i>Levit.</i> 19, 33. Polling and shaving of heads and
    beards is forbidden in <i>Deut.</i> 27. which was before prohibited in 22.
    It is written in <i>Exodus</i> the 20. Thou shalt not steale: and it is
    repeated in <i>Leviticus</i> 19. and in <i>Deut.</i> 5. Murther is generallie
    forbidden in <i>Exod.</i> 20. and likewise in 22. and repeated in <i>Num.</i> 35.
    But the aptest example is, that magicke is forbidden in three severall
    places, to wit, once/<span class="snp" id="p_121"><i>121.</i></span> in <i>Levit.</i> 19. and twise in <i>Levit.</i> 20. For the

    touching this kind of witchcraft, the principall part thereof
    consisteth in certeine confections prepared by lewd people to procure

    the braine of a cat, of a newt, or of a lizzard: the bone of a greene
    frog, the flesh thereof being consumed with pismers or ants; the left
    bone whereof ingendereth (as they saie) love; the bone on the right
    side, hate. Also it is said, that a frogs bones, the flesh being eaten
    off round about with ants, whereof some will swim, and some will sinke:
    those that sinke, being hanged up in a white linnen cloth, ingender
    love, but if a man be touched therewith, hate is bred thereby. Another

    Poisoners by medicine. Which when it is most usuall and proper, why
    should the translators take it in a signification lesse usuall, and
    nothing proper. Thus therefore he reasoneth and concludeth with his
    new found Logicke, and old fond Greeke; Sometimes
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>it signifieth so,
    though unproperlie, or rather metaphoricallie; <i>Ergo</i> in that place

    The <i>Septuaginta</i> had beene verie destitute of words, if no proper word

    againe praieng unto GOD that he would assist us, at the last he spake,
    but verie strangelie; and that was thus; He comes, he comes: and that
    oftentimes he repeated; and He goes, he goes. And then we/<span class="snp"><b>95.</b></span> charged him
    to tell us who sent him. And he said; I laie in her waie like a log,
    and I made hir runne like fier, but I could not hurt hir. And whie so,
    said we? Bicause God kept hir, said he. When camest thou to her, said
    we? To night in her bed, said he. Then we charged him as before, to
    tell what he was, and who sent him, and what his name was. At the first
    he said, The divell, the divell. Then we charged him as before. Then
    he rored and cried as before, and spake terrible words; I will kill
    hir, I will kill hir; I will teare hir in peeces, I will teare hir in
    peeces. We said, Thou shalt not hurt hir. He said, I will kill you all.
    We said, Thou shalt hurt none of us all. Then we charged him as before.
    Then he said, You will give me no rest. Wee said, Thou shalt have none
    here, for thou must have no rest within the servants of God: but tell
    us in the name of God what thou art, and who sent thee. Then he said
    he would teare hir in peeces. We said, Thou shalt not hurt hir. Then/<span class="snp" id="p_128"><i>128.</i></span>
    he said againe he would kill us all. We said againe, Thou shalt hurt
    none of us all, for we are the servants of God. And we charged him as
    before. And he said againe, Will you give me no rest? We said, Thou
    shalt have none here, neither shalt thou rest in hir, for thou hast
    no right in hir, sith Jesus Christ hath redeemed hir with his bloud,
    and she belongeth to him; and therefore tell us thy name, and who sent
    thee? He said his name was sathan. We said, Who sent thee? He said, Old
    <i>Alice</i>, old <i>Alice</i>. Which old <i>Alice</i>, said we? Old <i>Alice</i>, said he.
    Where dwelleth she, said we? In <i>Westwell</i> streete, said he. We said,
    How long hast thou beene with hir? These twentie yeares, said he. We
    asked him where she did keepe him? In two bottels, said he. Where be
    they, said we? In the backside of hir house, said he. In what place,
    said we? Under the wall, said he. Where is the other? In <i>Kenington</i>.
    In what place, said we? In the ground, said he. Then we asked him,
    what she did give him. He said, hir will, hir will. What did shee bid
    thee doo, said we? He said, Kill hir maid. Wherefore did she bid thee
    kill hir, said we? Bicause she did not love hir, said he. We said; How
    long is it ago, since she sent thee to hir? More than a yeare, said
    he.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
    Where was that, said we? At hir masters, said he. Which masters,
    said we? At hir master <i>Brainfords</i> at <i>Kenington</i>, said he. How oft
    wert thou there, said we? Manie times, said he. Where first, said we?
    In the garden, said he: Where the second time? In the hall: Where the
    third time? In hir bed: Where the fourth time? In the field: Where the
    fift time? In the court: Where the sixt time? In the water, where I
    cast hir into the mote: Where the seventh time. In hir bed. We asked
    him againe, where else? He said, in <i>Westwell</i>. Where there, said we?
    In the vicarige, said he. Where there? In the loft. How camest thou to
    hir, said we? In the likenesse of two birds, said he. Who sent thee
    to that place, said we? Old <i>Alice</i>, said he. What other spirits were
    with thee there, said we? My servant, said he. What is his name, said
    we? He said, little divell. What is thy name, said we? Sathan, said
    he. What dooth old <i>Alice</i> call thee, said we? Partener, said he. What
    dooth she give thee, said we? Hir will, said he. How manie hast thou
    killed for hir, said we? Three, said he. Who are they, said we? A man
    and his child, said/<span class="snp"><b>96.</b></span><span class="sni">[Mispr. 99]</span>
    he. What were their names, said we? The childs name was/<span class="snp" id="p_129"><i>129.</i></span>
    <i>Edward</i>, said he: what more than <i>Edward</i>, said we? <i>Edward
    Ager</i>, said he. What was the mans name, said we? <i>Richard</i>, said he.
    What more, said we? <i>Richard Ager</i>, said he. Where dwelt the man and
    the child, said we? At <i>Dig</i> at <i>Dig</i>, said he. This <i>Richard Ager</i> of
    <i>Dig</i>, was a Gentleman of xl. pounds land by the yeare, a verie honest
    man, but would often saie he was bewitched, and languished long before
    he died. Whom else hast thou killed for hir, said we? <i>Woltons</i> wife
    said he. Where did she dwell? In <i>Westwell</i> said he. What else hast
    thou doone for hir said we? What she would have me, said he. What is
    that said we? To fetch hir meat, drinke, and corne, said he. Where
    hadst thou it, said we? In everie house, said he. Name the houses,
    said we? At <i>Petmans</i>, at <i>Farmes</i>, at <i>Millens</i>, at <i>Fullers</i>, and
    in everie house. After this we commanded sathan in the name of Jesus
    Christ to depart from hir, and never to trouble hir anie more, nor anie
    man else. Then he said he would go, he would go: but he went not. Then
    we commanded him as before with some more words. Then he said, I go,
    I go; and so he departed. Then said the maid, He is gone, Lord have
    mercie upon me, for he would have killed me. And then we kneeled downe
    and gave God thanks with the maiden; praieng that God would keepe hir
    from sathans power, and assist hir with his grace. And noting this in
    a peece of paper, we departed. Sathans voice did differ much from the
    maids voice, and all that he spake, was in his owne name. <i>Subscribed

    false woonders. Neverthelesse, this sentence, and such like, have
    beene often laid in my dish, and are urged by diverse writers, to
    approve the miraculous working of witches, whereof I will treat more
    largelie in another place. Howbeit, by the waie I must confesse, that
    I take that sentence to be spoken of Antichrist, to wit: the pope, who
    miraculouslie, contrarie to nature, philosophie, and all divinitie,
    being of birth and calling base, in learning grosse; in valure,
    beautie, or activitie most commonlie a verie lubber, hath placed
    himselfe in the most loftie and delicate seate, putting almost all
    christian princes heads, not onelie under his girdle, but under his
    foote, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Surelie, the tragedie of this <i>Pythonist</i> is not inferior to a thousand
    stories, which will hardlie be blotted out of the memorie and credit
    either of the common people, or else of the learned. How hardlie will
    this storie suffer discredit, having testimonie of such authoritie? How
    could mother <i>Alice</i> escape condemnation and hanging, being arreigned
    upon this evidence; when a poore woman hath beene cast away, upon
    a cousening oracle, or rather a false lie, devised by <i>Feats</i> the
    juggler, through the malicious instigation of some of hir adversaries?</p>

  <p>But how cunninglie<span class="sni">The ventriloqua of Westwell discovered.</span>
    soever this last cited certificat be penned, or
    what shew soever it carrieth of truth and plaine dealing, there may be

    can hardlie be removed from the cre/dit<span class="snp" id="p_131"><i>131.</i></span> thereof, and without great
    disdaine cannot endure to heare the reproofe thereof. And know you
    this by the waie, that heretofore Robin goodfellow, and Hob gobblin
    were as terrible, and also as credible to the people, as hags and
    witches be now: and in time to come, a witch will be as much derided
    and contemned, and as plainlie perceived, as the illusion and knaverie
    of Robin goodfellow. And in truth, they that mainteine walking
    spirits, with their transformation, &amp;c: have no reason to denie Robin
    goodfellow, upon whom there hath gone as manie and as credible tales,
    as upon witches; saving that it hath not pleased the translators of the
    Bible, to call spirits by the name of Robin goodfellow, as they have
    termed divinors, soothsaiers, poisoners, and couseners by the name of
    witches.</p>

  <p>But to make short worke with the confutation of this bastardlie

    before M. <i>Thomas Wotton</i> of <i>Bocton Malherbe</i>, a man of great
    worship and wisedome, and for deciding and ordering of matters in
    this commonwealth, of rare and singular dexteritie; through whose

    <i>George Darrell</i><span class="sni">The Pythonist of west-well
    convicted by hir owne confession.</span> esquire, being also a right good and discreet Justice
    of the same limit, the fraud was found, the coosenage confessed,
    and she received condigne punishment. Neither was hir confession
    woone, according to the forme of the Spanish inquisition; to wit,
    through extremitie of tortures, nor yet by guile or flatterie, nor
    by presumptions; but through wise and perfect triall of everie
    circumstance the illusion was manifestlie disclosed: not so (I say)
    as/<span class="snp"><b>98.</b></span> witches are commonlie convinced and condemned; to wit, through
    malicious accusations, by ghesses, presumptions, and extorted
    confessions, contrarie to sense and possibilitie, and for such actions
    as they can shew no triall nor example before the wise, either by
    direct or indirect meanes; but after due triall she shewed hir feats,
    illusions, and transes, with the residue of all hir miraculous works,
    in the presence of divers gentlemen and gentlewomen of great worship
    and credit, at <i>Bocton Malherbe</i>, in the house of the aforesaid M.

    And of such foolish lies joined with bawdie tales, his whole booke

    Dutchman at <i>Maidstone</i> long after he had accomplished such knaveries,
    to the astonishment of a great number of good men, was revealed to be a

  <p class="subhead"><i>Of the great oracle of Apollo the Pythonist, and how men of all sorts

    this kind of witchcraft, <i>Apollo</i><span class="sni">The amphibologies
    of oracles.</span> and his oracles abused and
    cousened the whole world: which idoll was so famous, that I need not
    stand long in the description thereof. The princes and monarchs of
    the earth reposed no small confidence therein: the preests, which
    lived thereupon, were so cunning, as they also overtooke almost all
    the godlie and learned men of that age, partlie with their doubtfull
    answers; as that which was made unto <i>Pyrrhus</i>, in these words, <i>Aio
      te Aeacida Romanos vincere posse</i>, and to <i>Crœsus</i> his ambassadours in
    these words, <i>Si Crœsus arma Persis inferat, magnum imperium evertat</i>;
    and otherwise thus, <i>Crœsus Halin/ penetrans, magnam subvertet opum
    vim</i>:<span class="snp" id="p_134"><i>134.</i></span> or thus, <i>Crœsus perdet Halin, trangressus plurima regna, &amp;c</i>:
    partlie through confederacie, whereby they knew mens errands yer
    they came, and partlie by cunning, as promising victorie upon the
    sacrificing of some person of such account, as victorie should rather
    be neglected, than the murther accomplished. And if it were,<span class="sni">The subtiltie of oracles.</span> yet should
    there be such conditions annexed thereunto, as alwaies remained unto
    them a starting hole, and matter enough to cavill upon; as that the
    partie sacrificed must be a virgin, no bastard, &amp;c. Furthermore, of two
    things onelie proposed, and where yea or naie onelie dooth answer the
    question, it is an even laie, that an idiot shall conjecture right.
    So as, if things fell out contrarie, the fault was alwaies in the
    interpretor, and not in the oracle or the prophet. But what mervell,
    (I saie) though the multitude and common people have beene abused
    herein; since lawiers, philosophers, physicians, astronomers, divines,
    generall councels, and princes have with great negligence and ignorance
    been deceived and seduced hereby, as swallowing up and de/vouring<span class="snp"><b>100.</b></span> an
    inveterate opinion, received of their elders, without due examination
    of the circumstance?</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

  <p>Howbeit, the godlie and learned fathers (as it appeereth) have alwaies
    had a speciall care and respect, that they attributed not unto God such
    divelish devises; but referred them to him, who indeed is the inventer
    and author thereof, though not the personall executioner, in maner
    and forme as they supposed: so as the matter of faith was not thereby
    by them impeached. But who can assure himselfe not to be deceived in
    matters concerning spirits, <span class="sni">John. 20, 9.</span>when the apostles themselves were so far
    from knowing them, as even after the resurrection of Christ, having
    heard him preach and expound the scriptures, all his life time, they
    shewed themselves not onelie ignorant therein, but also to have
    misconceived thereof? Did not the apostle <i>Thomas</i> thinke that Christ
    himselfe had beene a spirit; until Christ told him plainelie, that a
    spirit was no such creature, as had flesh and bones, the which (he
    said) <i>Thomas</i> might see to be in him? And for the further certifieng
    and satisfieng of his mind, he commended unto him his hands to be
    seene, and his sides to be felt. <i>Thomas</i>, if the answer be true that
    some make hereunto, to wit: that spirits take formes and/<span class="snp" id="p_135"><i>135.</i></span> shapes of
    bodies at their pleasure, might have answered Christ, and remaining
    unsatisfied might have said; Oh sir, what do you tell me that spirits
    have no flesh and bones? Why they can take shapes and formes, and so
    perchance have you doone. Which argument all the witchmongers in the
    world shall never be able to answere.</p>

  <p>Some of them that mainteine the creation, the transformation, the
    transportation, and transubstantiation of witches, object that spirits
    are not palpable, though visible, and answer the place by me before
    cited: so as the feeling and not the seeing should satisfie <i>Thomas</i>.
    But he that shall well weigh the text and the circumstances thereof,
    shall perceive, that the fault of <i>Thomas</i> his incredulitie was
    secondlie bewraied, and condemned, in that he would not trust his owne
    eies, nor the view taken by his fellow apostles, who might have beene
    thought too credulous in this case, if spirits could take shapes at
    their pleasure. Jesus saith to him;<span class="sni">John. 20, 29.</span> Bicause thou hast seene (and not,
    bicause thou hast felt) thou beleevest. Item he saith; Blessed are they
    that beleeve and see not (and not, they that beleeve and feele not.)
    Whereby he noteth that our corporall eies may discerne betwixt a spirit
    and a naturall bodie; reprooving him, bicause he so much relied upon
    his externall senses, in cases where faith should have prevailed; &amp;
    here, in a matter of faith revealed in the word, would not credit the
    miracle which was exhibited unto him in most naturall and sensible sort.</p>

  <p>Howbeit, <i>Erastus</i><span class="sni"><i>Erast. fol. 62.</i></span>
    saith, and so dooth <i>Hyperius</i>, <i>Hemingius</i>, <i>Danæus</i>, <i>M.
    Mal. Bodin</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> that evill spirits eate, drinke, and keepe
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span> companie
    with men, and that they can take palpable formes of bodies, producing
    examples thereof, to wit: <i>Spectrum Germanicum seu Augustanum</i>, and
    the angell whose feet <i>Lot</i> washed; as though bicause God can indue
    his messengers with bodies at his pleasure, therefore the divell and
    everie spirit can doo the like. How the eleven apostles were in this
    case deceived, appeareth in <i>Luke.</i> 24.<span class="sni">Luk. 24, 37<br />Mark. 16, 14.<br />Mat. 14, 16.</span> and in <i>Mark.</i> 16. as also in
    <i>Matth.</i> 14. where the apostles and/<span class="snp"><b>101.</b></span> disciples were all deceived,
    taking Christ to be a spirit, when he walked on the sea. And why might
    they not be deceived herein, as well as in that they thought Christ had
    spoken of a temporall kingdome, when he preached<span class="sni">Matth. 20.</span> of the kingdome of
    hea/ven?<span class="snp" id="p_136"><i>136.</i></span> Which thing they also much misconceived; as likewise when he
    did bid them<span class="sni">Matt. 16, 11.</span> beware of the leven of the Pharisies, they understood that
    he spake of materiall bread.</p>

    <i>Alpes</i>, came to the temple of <i>Apollo</i>: where <i>Apollos</i> priest living
    richlie upon the revenues and benefit proceeding from that idoll, did
    give great intertainement unto <i>Gregorie</i>, and made him good cheare.
    But after <i>Gregorie</i> was gone, <i>Apollo</i> waxed dumbe, so as the priests
    gaines decaied: for the idoll growing into contempt, the pilgrimage
    ceased. The spirit taking compassion upon the priests case, and upon
    his greefe of mind in this behalfe, appeared unto him, and told him
    flatlie, that his late ghest <i>Gregorie</i> was the cause of all his
    miserie. For (saith the divell) he hath banished me, so that I cannot
    returne without a speciall licence or pasport from him. It was no need
    to bid the priest make hast, for immediatlie he tooke post horsses,
    and galloped after <i>Gregorie</i>, till at length he overtooke him, and
    then expostulated with him for this discourtesie profered in recompense
    of his good cheare; and said, that if he would not be so good unto
    him, as to write his letter to the divell in his behalfe, he should
    be utterlie/<span class="snp" id="p_137"><i>137.</i></span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
    undone. To be short, his importunitie was such, that he
    obtained <i>Gregorie</i> his letter to the divell, who wrote unto him in
    maner and forme following, word for word: <i>Permitto tibi redire in
    locum tuum, &amp; agere quæ consuevisti</i>; which is in English; I am content
    thou returne into thy place, and doo as thou wast woont. Immediatlie
    upon the receipt of this letter, the idoll spake as before. And here
    is to be noted, that as well in this, as in the<span class="sni">Note the cousenage of oracles.</span> execution of all
    their other oracles and cousenages, the answers were never given <i>Ex
    tempore</i>, or in that daie wherein the question was demanded, because
    forsooth they expected a vision (as they said) to be given the night
    following, whereby the cousenage might the more easilie be wrought./</p>

    need manie words to confute this fable? For if <i>Gregorie</i> had
    beene an honest man, he would never have willinglie permitted, that the
    people should have beene further cousened with such a lieng spirit:
    or if he had beene halfe so holie as <i>Eusebius</i> maketh him, he would
    not have consented or yeelded to so lewd a request of the priest,
    nor have written such an impious letter, no not though good might
    have come thereof. And therefore as well by the impossibilitie and
    follie conteined therein, as of the impietie (whereof I dare excuse
    <i>Gregorie</i>) you maie perceive it to be a lie. Me thinks they which
    still mainteine that the divell made answer in the idoll of <i>Apollo</i>,
    &amp;c: maie have sufficient persuasion to revoke their erronious opinions:
    in that it appeareth in record, that such men as were skilfull in
    augurie, did take upon them to give oracles at <i>Delphos</i>, in the place
    of <i>Apollo</i>: of which number <i>Tisanius</i> the sonne of <i>Antiochus</i><span class="sni">Zach. 10.</span>
    was one. But vaine is the answer of idols. Our Rood of grace, with
    the helpe of little S. <i>Rumball</i>, was not inferior to the idoll of
    <i>Apollo</i>:<span class="snp" id="p_138"><i>138.</i></span> for these could / not onlie worke externall miracles, but
    manifest the internall thoughts of the hart, I beleeve with more
    livelie shew, both of humanitie and also of divinitie, than the other.
    As if you read M. <i>Lamberts</i><span class="sni"><i>W. Lambert in titulo Boxley.</i></span>
    booke of the perambulation of <i>Kent</i>,
    it shall partlie appeare. But if you talke with them that have beene
    beholders thereof, you will be satisfied herein. And yet in the blind
    time of poperie, no man might (under paine of damnation) nor without
    danger of death, suspect the fraud. Naie, what papists will yet
    confesse they were idols, though the wiers that made their eies gogle,
    the pins that fastened them to the postes to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> make them seeme heavie,
    were seene and burnt together with the images themselves, the knaverie

    raised up <i>Samuel</i> from death, and the other words of the text are
    stronglie placed, to inforce his verie resurrection. The mind and
    opinion of Jesus Syrach evidentlie appeareth to be, that <i>Samuel</i>
    in person was raised out from his grave, as if you read <i>Eccl.</i> 46.
    19, 20. you shall plainlie perceive. Howbeit he disputeth not there,
    whether the storie be true or false, but onlie citeth certaine verses
    of the 1. booke of <i>Samuel cap.</i> 18. simplie, according to the letter,
    persuading maners and the imitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
    of our vertuous predecessors, and
    repeating the examples of diverse excellent men; namelie of <i>Samuel</i>:
    even as the text it selfe urgeth the matter, according to the deceived
    mind and imagination of <i>Saule</i>, and his servants. And therefore in
    truth, <i>Sirach</i> spake there according to the opinion of <i>Saule</i>, which
    so supposed, otherwise it is neither heresie nor treason to saie he was
    deceived.</p>

  <p>He that weigheth well that place, and looketh into it advisedlie,
    shall see that <i>Samuel</i> was not raised from the dead; but that
    it was an illusion or cousenage practised by the witch.<span class="sni">Sap

    the living should be taught by the dead. Which things are confirmed and
    approved by the example of <i>Lazarus</i><span class="sni">Luke. 16.</span> and <i>Dives</i>: where it appeareth

    bring up <i>Samuell</i>, when the witch would have raised hir divell. Which
    is a probable interpretation. But yet they dare not stand to that
    opinion, least they should impeach<span class="sni"><i>August. lib. quæ. vet. et novi testam. quæst. 27.<br />

    that <i>Samuell</i> himselfe was not called up. And indeed, if he were
    raised, it was either willinglie, or perforce: if it were willinglie,
    his sinne had beene equall with the witches.</p>

  <p>And <i>Peter Martyr</i> (me thinks) saith more to the purpose, in these
    words, to wit: This must have beene doone by Gods good will, or
    perforce of art magicke: it could not be doone by his good will,
    bicause he forbad it; nor by art, bicause witches have no power over
    the godlie. Where it is answered by some, that the commandement was
    onlie to prohibit the<span class="sni">Deut. 18,<br />Exodus. 20.</span> Jewes to aske counsell of the dead, and so
    no fault in <i>Samuell</i> to give counsell. We may as well excuse our
    neighbours wife, for consenting to our filthie desires, bicause it is
    onlie written in the decalog; Thou shalt not desire thy neighbours
    wife. But indeed <i>Samuell</i> was directlie forbidden to answer <i>Saule</i>
    before he died: and therefore it was not likelie that God would appoint
    him, when he was dead, to doo it.</p>

    of the elect enjoy or possesse in <i>Abrahams</i> bosome, if they were to be
    plucked from thence at a witches call and commandement? But so should
    the divell have power in heaven, where he is unworthie to have anie

  <p>Manie other of the fathers are flatlie against the raising up of
    <i>Samuell</i>: namelie, <i>Tertullian</i> in his booke <i>De anima</i>, <i>Justine
    Martyr In explicatione, quæ.</i> 25. <i>Rabanus In epistolis ad Bonas.
    Abat, Origen In historia de Bileamo, &amp;c.</i> Some other dote exceedinglie
    herein, as namelie <i>Bodin</i>, and all the papists in generall: also
    <i>Rabbi Sedias Haias</i>, &amp; also all the Hebrues, saving <i>R. David Kimhi</i>,
    which is the best writer of all the <i>Rabbins</i>: though never a good
    of them all. But <i>Bodin</i>,<span class="sni"><i>J. Bod. lib. de dæm. 2.
    cap. 3.</i></span> in maintenance therof, falleth into manie
    absurdities, prooving by the small faults that <i>Saule</i> had committed,
    that he was an elect: for the greatest matter (saith he) laid unto his
    charge, is the reserving of the <i>Amalekits</i><span class="sni">1. Samu. 28.</span> cattell, &amp;c. He was an
    elect, &amp;c: confirming his opinion with manie ridiculous fables, &amp; with
    this argument, to wit: His fault was too little to deserve damnation;
    for <i>Paule</i><span class="sni">1. Cor. 5.</span> would not have the incestuous man punished too sore,
    that his soule might be saved. <i>Justine Martyr</i><span class="sni"><i>J. Martyr in colloquio cum Triphone Judæo.</i></span> in another place was
    not onlie deceived in the actuall raising up of <i>Samuels</i> soule, but
    affirmed that all the soules of the prophets and just men are subject
    to the power of witches./<span class="snp"><b>105.</b></span> And yet were the Heathen much more fond
    herein, who (as <i>Lactantius</i><span class="sni"><i>Lact. lib. 7. cap. 13.</i></span> affirmeth) boasted that they could call up
    the soules of the dead, and yet did thinke that their soules died with
    their bodies. Whereby is to be seene, how alwaies the world hath beene
    abused in the matters of witchcraft &amp; conjuration. The Necromancers
    affirme, that the spirit of anie man may be called up, or recalled (as
    they terme it) before one yeare be past after their departure from the
    bodie. Which <i>C. Agrippa</i> in his booke <i>De occulta philosophia</i> saith,
    may be doone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
    by certeine naturall forces and bonds. And therefore
    corpses in times past were accompanied and watched with lights,
    sprinkled with holie water, perfumed with incense, and purged with
    praier all the while they were above ground: otherwise the serpent
    (as the Maisters of the Hebrues saie) would devoure them, as the food
    appointed to him by God: <i>Gen.</i> 3. alled/ging<span class="snp" id="p_142"><i>142.</i></span> also this place; We shall
    not all sleepe, but we shall be changed, bicause manie shall remaine
    for perpetuall meate to the serpent: whereupon riseth the contention
    betweene him and <i>Michaell</i>,<span class="sni">Jud. vers. 9.</span> concerning the bodie of <i>Moses</i>; wherein
    scripture is alledged. I confesse that <i>Augustine</i>, and the residue
    of the doctors, that denie the raising of <i>Samuell</i>, conclude, that
    the divell was fetcht up in his likenesse: from whose opinions (with
    reverence) I hope I may dissent.</p>

  <h3>The tenth Chapter.</h3>

  <p class="subhead"><i>That neither the divell nor Samuell was raised, but that it was a

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_a.png" width="75" height="75" alt='A' /></span>GAINE,
    if the divell appeared, and not <i>Samuell</i>: whie is it said in
    <i>Eccle.</i> that he slept? for the divell neither sleepeth nor dieth.
    But in truth we may gather, that it was neither the divell in person,
    nor <i>Samuell</i>: but a circumstance is here described, according to the
    deceived opinion and imagination of <i>Saule</i>. Howbeit <i>Augustine</i> saith,
    that both these sides may easilie be defended. But we shall not need
    to fetch an exposition so farre off: for indeed (me thinkes) it is
    <i>Longè petita</i>; nor to descend so lowe as hell, to fetch up a divell to
    expound this place. For it is ridiculous (as <i>Pompanacius</i><span class="sni"><i>Pompanacius
    lib. de incant. cap. 2.</i></span> saith) to
    leave manifest things, and such as by naturall reason may be prooved,
    to seeke unknowne things, which by no likeliehood can be conceived, nor
    tried by anie rule of reason. But in so much as we have libertie by S.
    <i>Augustines</i> rule, in such places of scripture as seeme to conteine
    either contrarietie or absurditie, to varie from the letter, and to
    make a godlie construction agreeable to the word; let us confesse that
    <i>Samuell</i> was not raised (for that were repugnant to the word) and see
    whether this illusion may not be contrived by the art and cunning of
    the woman, without anie of these supernaturall devices: for I could
    cite a hundred papisticall and cousening practises, as/<span class="snp" id="p_143"><i>143.</i></span> difficult as
    this, and as cleanlie handled. And it is to be surelie thought, if it
    had beene a divell, the text would have noted it in some place of the
    storie: as it dooth not. But <i>Bodin</i> helpeth me exceedinglie in this
    point, wherein he for/saketh<span class="snp"><b>106.</b></span> (he saith) <i>Augustine</i>, <i>Tertullian</i>, and
    <i>D. Kimhi</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
    himselfe, who saie it was the divell that was raised up:
    which (saith <i>Bodin)</i><span class="sni"><i>J. Bod. lib. de dæm. 2. cap. 3.</i></span>
    could not be; for that in the same communication
    betweene <i>Saule</i> and <i>Samuell</i>, the name of <i>Jehovah</i> is five times
    repeated, of which name the divell cannot abide the hearing.</p>

  <h3>The eleventh Chapter.</h3>

  <p class="subhead"><i>The objection of the witchmongers concerning this place fullie

    such a supernaturall miracle is wrought, no doubt it is a
    testimonie of truth; as <i>Peter Martyr</i><span class="sni"><i>P. Martyr in comment. in Sam. 28. verse. 9.</i></span> affirmeth. And in this case it
    should have beene a witnesse of lies: for (saith he) a matter of such
    weight cannot be attributed unto the divell, but it is the mightie
    power of God that dooth accomplish it. And if it laie in a witches
    power to call up a divell, yet it lieth not in a witches power to
    worke such miracles:<span class="sni">Isai. 42.<br />1. Sam. 28.</span> for God will not give his power and glorie to
    anie creature. To understand this place, we must diligentlie examine
    the circumstance thereof. It was well knowne that <i>Saule</i>, before he
    resorted to the witch, was in despaire of the mercies and goodnes of
    God; partlie for that <i>Samuell</i> told him long before, that he should be
    overthrowne, and <i>David</i> should have his place; and partlie bicause God
    before had refused to answer him, either by <i>Samuell</i> when he lived, or
    by anie other prophet, or by <i>Urim</i> or <i>Thumim</i>, &amp;c. And if you desire
    to see this matter discussed, turne to the first of <i>Samuell</i>, the 28.
    chapter, and conferre my words therewith./</p>

  <p><span class="snp" id="p_144"><i>144.</i></span><i>Saule</i> seeing the host of the <i>Philistines</i> come upon him (which thing
    could not be unknown to all the people) fainted, bicause he sawe their
    strength, and his owne weaknesse, and speciallie that he was forsaken:
    so as being now straught of mind, desperate, and a verie foole, he
    goeth<span class="sni">1. Sam. 28, 7.</span> to certeine of his servants, that sawe in what taking he was,
    and asked them for a woman that had a familiar spirit, and they told
    him by and by that there dwelt one at <i>Endor</i>. By the waie you shall
    understand, that both <i>Saule</i> and his servants ment such a one as
    could by hir spirit raise up <i>Samuell</i>, or any other that was dead and
    buried. Wherein you see they were deceived, though it were true, that
    she tooke upon hir so to doo. To what use then served hir familiar
    spirit, which you conceive she had, bicause <i>Saules</i> servants said so?
    Surelie, as they were deceived and abused in part, so doubtlesse were
    they in the rest. For to what purpose<span class="sni">S. Cicilies familiar.</span> (I saie) should hir familiar
    serve,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
    if not for such intents as they reported, and she undertooke? I
    thinke you will grant that <i>Saules</i> men never sawe hir familiar: for I
    never heard any yet of credit saie, that he was so much in the witches
    favour, as to see hir divell; although indeed we read among the popish
    trumperie, that S. <i>Cicilie</i> had an angell to hir familiar, and that
    she could shew him to whom she would, and that she might aske and have
    what she or hir/<span class="snp"><b>107.</b></span> friend list: as appeareth in the lesson read in the
    popish church on saint <i>Cicilies</i> daie. Well, I perceive the woman of
    <i>Endors</i> spirit was a counterfeit, and kept belike in hir closet at
    <i>Endor</i>, or in the bottle, with mother <i>Alices</i> divell at <i>Westwell</i>,
    and are now bewraied and fled togither to <i>Limbo patrum</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> And
    though <i>Saule</i> were bewitched and blinded in the matter; yet doubtlesse
    a wise man wold have perchance espied her knaverie. Me thinks <i>Saule</i>
    was brought to this witch, much after the maner that doctor <i>Burcot</i>
    was brought to <i>Feats</i>,<span class="sni">D. Burcot. Feats.</span> who sold maister Doctor a familiar, wherby he
    thought to have wrought miracles, or rather to have gained good store
    of monie. This fellowe by the name of <i>Feats</i> was a jugler, by the name
    of <i>Hilles</i> a witch or conjurer, everie waie a cousener: his qualities
    and feats were to me and manie other well knowne and detected. And yet
    the opinion conceived of him was most strange and woonderfull; even
    with such and in such cases, as it greeveth me to thinke of; speciallie
    bicause his knaverie and cou/senage<span class="snp" id="p_145"><i>145.</i></span> reached to the shedding of innocent
    bloud. But now forsooth <i>Saule</i><span class="sni">1. Sam. 28, 8</span> covereth himselfe with a net; and
    bicause he would not be knowne, he put on other garments. But to bring
    that matter to passe, he must have beene cut shorter<span class="sni">1. Sa 10, 23.</span> by the head and
    shoulders, for by so much he was higher than any of the people. And
    therfore whatsoever face the craftie quene did set upon it, she knew
    him well enough. And for further proofe thereof, you may understand,
    that the princes of the Jewes were much conversant with the people. And
    it appeereth manifestlie, that <i>Saule</i><span class="sni">Ibidem.</span> dwelt verie neere to <i>Endor</i>,
    so as she should the rather knowe him; for in the evening he went
    from his lodging unto hir house: neither should it seeme that she was
    gone to bed when he came. But bicause that may be uncerteine, you may
    see in the processe of the text, that in a peece of the night he went
    from his house to hirs, and with much adoo intreated her to consent to
    his request. She finished hir conjuration, so as both <i>Saules</i> part,
    the witches part, and also <i>Samuels</i> part was plaied: and after the
    solemnization therof, a calfe was killed, a batch of bread baked, and
    a supper made readie and eaten up; and after all this, he went home
    the same night: and had need so to doo, for he had some businesse the
    next daie. By these and manie other circumstances it may bee gathered,
    that she dissembled, in saieng she knew him not,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span> and consequentlie
    counterfaited, and made a foole of him in all the rest.</p>

  <p>It appeereth there, that he,<span class="sni">Ibidem.</span> with a couple of his men, went to hir by
    night, and said; Conjecture unto me by thy familiar spirit, and bring
    me up whom I shall name unto thee. The godlie learned knowe that this
    was not in the power of the witch of <i>Endor</i>, but in the God of heaven
    onelie to accomplish. Howbeit, <i>Saule</i> was bewitched so to suppose:
    and yet is he more simple that will be overtaken with the devises of
    our old witches, which are produced to resemble hir. And why should we
    thinke, that GOD would rather permit the witch to raise <i>Samuel</i>, than
    that <i>Dives</i> could obteine <i>Lazarus</i> to come out of <i>Abrahams</i> bosome,
    upon more likelie and more reasonable conditions? Well now dooth
    this strumpet (according to the guise of our cousening witches and
    conjurers) make the matter strange unto <i>Saule</i>,<span class="sni">1 Sam. 28, 9.</span> saieng that he came
    to take hir in a snare, &amp;c./<span class="snp"><b>108.</b></span> But witches
    seldome make/<span class="snp" id="p_146"><i>146.</i></span> this objection,
    saving when they mistrust that he which commeth to them will espie
    their jugling: for otherwise, where the witchmonger is simple and easie
    to be abused, the witch will be as easie to be intreated, and nothing
    dangerous of hir cunning; as you see this witch was soone persuaded
    (notwithstanding that objection) bicause she perceived and sawe that
    <i>Saule</i> was affraid and out of his wits. And therfore she said unto
    him;<span class="sni">1. Sa. 28. 12.</span> Whom shall I raise up? As though she could have brought unto him
    <i>Abraham</i>, <i>Isaac</i>, or <i>Jacob</i>; who cannot heare us, therefore cannot
    rise at our call. For it is written;<span class="sni">Isa. 63, 15. 16</span> Looke thou downe from heaven
    and behold us, &amp;c: as for <i>Abraham</i> he is ignorant of us, and Israel

    manner and circumstance of their communication, or of hir
    conjuration, is not verbatim set downe and expressed in the text; but
    the effect thereof breeflie touched: yet will I shew you the common
    order of their conjuration, and speciallie of hirs at this time used.
    When <i>Saule</i><span class="sni">The maner of the witch of Endors cousening of Saule.</span>
    had told hir, that he would have <i>Samuel</i> brought up to
    him, she departed from his presence into hir closet, where doubtles she
    had hir familiar; to wit, some lewd craftie preest, and made <i>Saule</i>
    stand at the doore like a foole (as it were with his finger in a hole)
    to heare the cousening answers, but not to see the cousening handling
    thereof,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> and the couterfetting of the matter. And so goeth she to
    worke, using ordinarie words of conjuration, of which there are sundrie
    varieties and formes (whereof I shall have occasion to repeat some in
    another place) as you see the juglers (which be inferior conjurors)
    speake certeine strange words of course to lead awaie the eie from
    espi/eng<span class="snp" id="p_147"><i>147.</i></span> the maner of their conveiance, whilest they may induce the
    mind to conceive and suppose that he dealeth with spirits; saieng,
    <i>Hay, fortune furie, nunq; credo, passe, passe, when come you sirra</i>.
    So belike after many such words spoken, she saith to hir selfe; Lo now
    the matter is brought to passe, for I see woonderfull things. So as
    <i>Saule</i><span class="sni">1. Sa. 28, 13.</span> hearing these words, longed to knowe all, and asked hir what
    she sawe. Whereby you may know that <i>Saule</i> sawe nothing, but stood
    without like a mome, whilest she plaied hir part in hir closet: as
    may most evidentlie appeere by the 21. verse<span class="sni">1. Sa. 28, 21.</span> of this chapter where
    it is said; Then the woman came out unto <i>Saule</i>. Howbeit, a little
    before she cunninglie counterfaited that she sawe <i>Samuel</i>, and thereby
    knewe it was <i>Saule</i> that was come unto hir. Whereby all the world may
    perceive the cousening, and hir dissimulation. For by that which hath
    beene before said, it must needs be that she knew him. And (I praie
    you) why should she not have suspected aswell him to be <i>Saule</i> before,
    when in expresse words he required hir to bring unto him <i>Samuel</i>, as
    now, when <i>Samuel</i> appeered unto hir?/</p>

  <p><span class="snp"><b>109.</b></span>Well, to the question before proposed by <i>Saule</i>,
    <span class="sni">1. Sa. 28, 4.</span> she answereth and
    lieth, that she saw angels or gods ascending up out of the earth. Then
    proceedeth she with her inchanting phrases and words of course: so as
    thereby <i>Saule</i> gathereth and supposeth that she hath raised a man. For
    otherwise his question dependeth not upon any thing before spoken. For
    when she hath said; I sawe angels ascending, &amp;c: the next word he saith
    is; What fashion is he of? Which (I saie) hangeth not upon hir last
    expressed words. And to this she answered not directlie, that it was
    <i>Samuel</i>; but that it was an old man lapped in a mantell: as though she
    knew not him that was the most notorious man in Israell, that had beene
    her neighbour by the space of manie yeeres, and upon whom (while he
    lived) everie eie was fixed, and whom also she knew within lesse than a
    quarter of an houre before, as by whose meanes also she came acquainted
    with <i>Saule</i>.<span class="sni">1. Sa. 28, 12.</span> Read the text and see.</p>

  <p>But she describeth his personage, and the apparell which he did
    usuallie weare when he lived: which if they were both buried togither,
    were consumed and rotten, or devoured with wormes before that time.
    Belike he had a new mantell made him in hea/ven:<span class="snp" id="p_148"><i>148.</i></span> and yet they saie
    Tailors are skantie there, for that their consciences are so large
    here. In this countrie, men give awaie their garments when
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span> they die:
    if <i>Samuel</i> had so doone, hee could not have borrowed it againe; for
    of likliehood it would have beene worne out in that space, except the
    donee had beene a better husband than I: for the testator was dead (as
    it is supposed) two yeares before.</p>

  <h3>The xiii. Chapter.</h3>

  <p class="subhead"><i>The residue of 1. Sam. 28. expounded: wherin is declared how
    cunninglie this witch brought Saule resolutelie to beleeve that she
    raised Samuel, what words are used to colour the cousenage, and how all
    might also be wrought by ventriloquie.</i></p>

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_n.png" width="75" height="75" alt='N' /></span>OW
    commeth in <i>Samuel</i> to plaie his part: but I am persuaded it was
    performed in the person of the witch hir selfe, or of hir confederate.
    He saith to <i>Saule</i>;<span class="sni">1. Sa. 28, 15.</span> Why has thou disquieted me, to bring me up? As
    though without guile or packing it had beene <i>Samuel</i> himselfe. <i>Saule</i><span class="sni">Ibidem.</span>
    answered that he was in great distresse: for the <i>Philistines</i> made
    warre upon him. Whereby the witch, or hir confederate priest might
    easilie conjecture that his heart failed, and direct the oracle or
    prophesie accordinglie: especiallie understanding by his present talke,
    and also by former prophesies and dooings that were past, that God
    had forsaken him, and that his people were declining from him. For
    when <i>Jonathan</i><span class="sni">1. Sam 13, 5.</span> (a little before) overthrew the <i>Philistines</i>, being
    thirtie thousand chariots and six thousand horssemen; <i>Saule</i> could not
    assemble above six hundred souldiers.<span class="sni">1. Sa. 13, 15.</span></p>

  <p>Then said <i>Samuel</i> (which some suppose was sathan, and as I thinke
    was the witch, with a confederate; for what need so farre fetches,
    as to fetch a divell supernaturallie out of hell, when the illusion
    may be here by natu/rall<span class="snp"><b>110.</b></span> meanes deciphered? And if you note the words
    well, you shall perceive the phrase not to come out/<span class="snp" id="p_149"><i>149.</i></span> of a spirituall
    mouth of a divell, but from a lieng corporall toong of a cousener,
    that careth neither for God nor the divell, frō whence issueth such
    advise and communication, as greatlie disagreeth from sathans nature
    and purpose. For thus (I saie) the said <i>Samuel</i> speaketh: Wherefore
    dooest thou aske me,<span class="sni">1. Sam. 28. 16. 17.</span> seeing the Lord is gone from thee, and is thine
    enemie? Even the Lord hath doon unto him as he spake by mine hand:<span class="sni">1. Sa. 15, 28.</span> for
    the Lord will rent thy kingdome out of thine hand, and give it to thy
    neighbour <i>David</i>, bicause thou obeiedst not the voice of the Lord, &amp;c.
    This (I say) is no phrase of a divell, but of a cousener, which knew
    before what <i>Samuel</i> had prophesied concerning <i>Saules</i> destruction.
    For it is the divels condition, to allure the people unto wickednes,
    and not in this sort to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
    admonish, warne, and rebuke them for evill.
    And the popish writers confes, that the divell would have beene gone at
    the first naming of God. If it bee said, that it was at Gods speciall
    commandement and will, that <i>Samuel</i> or the divell should be raised, to
    propound this admonition, to the profit of all posteritie: I answer,
    that then he would rather have doone it by some of his living prophets,
    and that sathan had not beene so fit an instrument for that purpose.
    After this falleth the witch (I would saie <i>Samuel</i>) into the veine of
    prophesieng, and speaketh to <i>Saule</i><span class="sni">1. Sa 28, 17.<br />18.</span> on this wise; The Lord will rent
    thy kingdome out of thine hand, and give it to thy neighbor <i>David</i>,
    bicause thou obeiedst not the voice of the Lord, nor executedst his
    fierse wrath upon the <i>Amalekites</i>: therefore hath the Lord doone this
    unto thee this daie.<span class="sni">19.</span> Moreover, the Lord will deliver thee into the
    hands of the <i>Philistines</i>, and to morrowe shalt thou and thy sonnes be
    with me, and the Lord shall give the host of Israel into the hands of
    the <i>Philistines</i>. What could <i>Samuel</i> have said more?</p>

  <p>Me thinks the divell would have used another order, encouraging <i>Saule</i>
    rather than rebuking him for his evill. The divell is craftier than to
    leave such an admonition to all posterities, as should be prejudiciall
    unto his kingdome, and also be void of all impietie. But so divine a
    sentence maketh much for the maintenance of the witches credit, and
    to the advancement of hir gaines. Howbeit, concerning the veritie of
    this prophesie, there be many disputable questions: first, whether
    the battell were fought the next daie; secondlie, whether all his
    sonnes were kil/led<span class="snp" id="p_150"><i>150.</i></span> with him; item, whether they went to heaven or
    hell togither, as being with <i>Samuel</i>, they must be in heaven, and
    being with sathan, they must be in hell. But although everie part of
    this prophesie were false, as that all his sonnes were not slaine
    (<i>Ishbosheth</i> living and reigning in Israel two yeares after <i>Saules</i>
    death) and that the battell was not on the morrow, and that wicked
    <i>Saule</i>, after that he had killed himselfe, was not with good <i>Samuel</i>;<span class="sni">2. Reg. 4.</span>
    yet this witch did give a shrewd gesse to the sequele. Which whether
    it were true or false, perteins not to my purpose; and therfore I
    will omit it. But as touching the opinion of them that saie it was
    the divell, bicause that such things came to passe; I would faine
    knowe of them where they learne that divels foreknow things to come.
    If they saie he gesseth onelie upon probabilities, the witch may also
    doo the like. But here I may not forget the decrees,<span class="sni"><i>Canon.
    26. quæst. cap. 5. nec mirum.</i></span> which conclude,
    that <i>Samuel</i> appeered not unto <i>Saule</i>; but that the historiographer
    set foorth/<span class="snp"><b>111.</b></span> <i>Saules</i> mind and <i>Samuels</i> estate, and certeine things
    which were said &amp; seene, omitting whether they were true or false: and
    further, that it were a great offense for a man to beleeve the bare
    words of the storie. And if this exposition like you not, I can easilie
    frame my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
    selfe to the opinion of some of great learning, expounding
    this place, and that with great probabilitie, in this sort; to wit,
    that this <i>Pythonist</i> being <i>Ventriloqua</i>; that is, Speaking as it
    were from the bottome of hir bellie, did cast hir selfe into a transe,
    and so abused <i>Saule</i>, answering to <i>Saule</i> in <i>Samuels</i> name, in hir
    counterfeit hollow voice: as the wench of <i>Westwell</i> spake, whose
    historie I have rehearsed before at large, in pag. 127 and this is

  <p class="subhead"><i>Opinions of some learned men, that Samuel was indeed raised, not by

    and <i>Sadaias</i> write, that when the woman sawe the miracle indeed,
    and more than she looked for, or was woont to doo; she began to crie
    out, that this was a vision indeed, and a true one, not doone by hir
    art, but by the power of God. Which exposition is far more probable
    than our late writers judgements hereupon, and agreeth with the
    exposition of diverse good divines. <i>Gelasius</i> saith, it was the verie
    spirit of <i>Samuel</i>: and where he suffered himself to be worshipped, it
    was but in civill salutation and courtesie; and that God did interpose
    <i>Samuel</i>,<span class="sni">J. Bodin &amp; L. vairus differ herein.</span>
    as he did <i>Elias</i> to the messenger of <i>Ochosias</i>, when he
    sent to <i>Belzebub</i> the god of <i>Acharon</i>. And here is to be noted, that
    the witchmongers are set up in this point: for the papists saie, that
    it cannot be a divell, bicause Jehovah is thrise or five times named
    in the storie. Upon this peece of scripture arguments are daielie
    devised, to proove and mainteine the miraculous actions of witchcraft,
    and the raising of the dead by conjurations. And yet if it were true,
    that <i>Samuel</i> himselfe were raised, or the divell in his likenesse;
    and that the witch of <i>Endor</i> by hir art and cunning did it, &amp;c: it
    maketh rather to the disproofe than to the proofe of our witches, which
    can neither do that kind of miracle, or any other, in any such place
    or companie, where their jugling and cousenage may be seen and laid
    open. And I challenge<span class="sni">A bold, discreet, and faithfull
    challenge</span> them all (even upon the adventure of my life)
    to shew one peece of a miracle, such as Christ did trulie, or such
    as they suppose this witch did diabolicallie, be it not with art nor
    confederacie, whereby some colour thereof may be made; neither are
    there any such visions in these daies shewed.</p>

  <p>Heretofore God did send his visible angels to men: but now/<span class="snp" id="p_152"><i>152</i></span> we heare
    not of such apparitions, neither are they necessarie. Indeed it
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
    pleased God heretofore, by the hand of <i>Moses</i> and his prophets,
    and speciallie by his sonne Christ and his apostles, to worke great
    miracles, for the establish/ing<span class="snp"><b>112.</b></span> of the faith: but now whatsoever is
    necessarie for our salvation, is conteined in the word of God: our
    faith is alredie confirmed, and our church established by miracles;
    so as now to seeke for them, is a point of infidelitie. Which the
    papists (if you note it) are greatlie touched withall, as in their
    lieng legends appeareth. But in truth, our miracles are knaveries
    most commonlie, and speciallie of priests, whereof I could cite a
    thousand. If you read the storie of Bell and the dragon, you shall find
    a cousening miracle of some antiquitie. If you will see newer devises,

    spirits and divels have not personallie appeared, as in times past
    they were woont to doo. This argument is taken in hand of the ancient
    fathers, to proove the determination and ceasing of oracles. For in
    times past (saith <i>Athanasius</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Athanas. de
    humanitate verbi.</i></span> divels in vaine shapes did intricate
    men with their illusions, hiding themselves in waters, stones, woods,

    and mockeries of images are ceased. Truelie, if all such oracles, as
    that of <i>Apollo</i>, &amp;c. (before the comming of Christ) had beene true,
    and doone according to the report, which hath beene brought through
    divers ages, and from farre countries unto us, without preestlie fraud

    <i>Urim</i> nor <i>Thumim</i>, as he was woont, &amp;c. And yet to leave the divell
    in the mouth of a witch, or an idoll to prophesie or worke miracles,
    &amp;c: to the hinderance of his glorious gospell,<span class="sni">The

    whereas the working of miracles was the onelie, or at least the most

    this witch of <i>Endor</i> had performed that, which manie conceive
    of the matter, it might have beene compared with the raising up of
    <i>Lazarus</i>.<span class="sni">An ironicall collation.</span> I praie you, is not the converting of water into milke, as
    hard a matter as the turning of water into wine? And yet, as you may
    read in the gospell, that Christ did the one, as his first miracle; so
    may you read in <i>M. Mal.</i><span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef. par. 2. quæ.
    1. cap. 14.</i></span> and in <i>Bodin</i>, that witches can easilie doo
    the other: yea, and that which is a great deale more, of water they can
    make butter. But to avoid all cavils, and least there should appeare
    more matter in Christs miracle, than the others, you shall find in <i>M.
    Mal.</i> that they can change water into wine: and what is it to attribute
    to/<span class="snp" id="p_155"><i>155.</i></span> a creature, the power and worke of the creator, if this be not?
    Christ saith, <i>Opera quæ ego facio nemo potest facere</i>.<span class="sni">Acts.

    witch nor divell: for God is the onlie giver of life and being, and by
    him all things are made, visible and invisible.</p>

  <p>Finallie, this woman of <i>Endor</i> is in the scripture called
    <i>Pythonissa</i>: whereby it may appeare that she was but a verie
    cousener. For <i>Pytho</i> himselfe, whereof <i>Pythonissa</i> is derived, was
    a counterfet. And the originall storie of <i>Apollo</i>,<span class="sni">Apollo Pytho uncased.</span> who was called
    <i>Pytho</i>, bicause he killed a serpent of that name, is but a poeticall
    fable. For the poets saie he was the god of musicke, physicke, poetrie,
    and shooting. In heaven he is called <i>Sol</i>, in earth <i>Liber pater</i>,
    in hell <i>Apollo</i>. He florisheth alwaies with perpetuall youth, and
    therefore he is painted without a beard: his picture was kept as an
    oracle-giver: and the preests that attended thereon at <i>Delphos</i> were
    couseners, and called <i>Pythonists</i> of <i>Pytho</i>, as papists of <i>Papa</i>;
    and afterwards all women that used that
    trade, were named <i>Pythonissæ</i>, as was this woman of <i>Endor</i>.
    But bicause it concerneth this matter, I will breefelie note
    the opinions of divers learned men, and cer-
    teine other proofes, which I find in the
    scripture touching the ceasing of
    miracles, prophesies and

    in times past, it pleased God,<span class="sni">Psal. 136. 4.<br />Psal.
    72. 18.<br />Psal. 88. 10.</span> extraordinarilie to shew
    miracles amongest his people, for the strengthening of their faith in
    the Messias; and againe at his comming to confirme their faith by his
    wonderfull dooings, and his speciall graces and gifts bestowed by him
    upon the apostles, &amp;c: yet we ordinarilie read in the scriptures, that
    it is the Lord that worketh great wonders. Yea <i>David</i> saith, that
    among the dead (as in this case of <i>Samuel</i>)<span class="sni">Isai. 42.<br />
    John 3, 2.<br />Ibid. 7, 16.<br /><i>In annotat. in Johan. 3.</i></span> God himselfe sheweth no
    wonders. I find also that God will not give his glorie and power to a
    creature. <i>Nichodemus</i> being a Pharisie could saie, that no man could
    do such miracles as Christ did, except God were with him, according
    to the saieng of the prophet to those gods and idols, which tooke on
    them the power of God;<span class="sni">Isai. 45.</span> Doo either good or ill if you can, &amp;c. So as
    the prophet knew and taught thereby, that none but God could worke
    miracles. Infinite places for this purpose might be brought out of the
    scripture, which for brevitie I omit and overslip.</p>

  <p>S. <i>Augustine</i>,<span class="sni"><i>August. de verbis Dom.
    secundum Matth. sermone. 18.</i></span> among other reasons, whereby he prooveth the ceasing
    of miracles, saith; Now blind flesh dooth not open the eies of the
    blind by the miracle of God, but the eies of our hart are opened by
    the word of God. Now is not our dead carcase raised any more up by
    miracle, but our dead bodies be still in the grave,/<span class="snp" id="p_157"><i>157.</i></span> and our soules are
    raised to life by Christ. Now the eares of the deafe are not opened
    by miracle, but they which had their eares shut before, have them now
    opened to their salvation. The miraculous healing of the sicke, by
    annointing, spoken of by S. <i>James</i>,<span class="sni">James. 5, 14.</span> is objected by manie, speciallie
    by the papists, for the maintenance of their sacrament of extreame
    unction: which is apishlie and vainelie used in the Romish church, as
    though that miraculous gift had continuance till this daie: wherein
    you shall see what <i>Calvine</i><span class="sni"><i>J. Calvin. Institut.
    lib. 4. cap. 19. sect. 18.</i></span> speaketh in his institutions. The grace
    of healing (saith he) spoken of by S. <i>James</i>, is vanished awaie, as
    also the other miracles, which the Lord would have shewed onelie for a
    time, that he might make the new preaching of the gospell mervellous
    for ever.<span class="sni"><i>Idem. ibid. sect. 19.</i><br />Isai. 9. 7.</span>
    Why (saith he) doo not these (meaning miraclemongers)
    appoint some <i>Siloah</i> to swim in, whereinto at certeine ordinarie
    recourses of times sicke folke maie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
    plunge themselves? Why doo they
    not lie a long upon the dead, bicause <i>Paule</i><span class="sni">Acts.
    20, 10.<br /><i>Idem. ibid. nempe J. Calvine.</i></span> raised up a dead child
    by that meanes? Verelie (saith he) <i>James</i> in the miracle to annoint,
    spake for that time, whiles the church still enjoied such blessings
    of God. Item, he saith, that the Lord is present with his in all
    ages; and so often as need is, he helpeth their sicknesses, no lesse
    than in old time. But he dooth not so utter his manifest powers, nor
    distributeth miracles, as by the hands of the apostles, bicause the
    gift was but for a time. <i>Calvine</i> even there concludeth thus; They
    saie such vertues or miracles remaine, but experience saith naie. And
    see how they agree among themselves. <i>Danæus</i> saith, that neither
    witch nor divell can worke miracles. <i>Giles Alley</i> saith directlie,/<span class="snp"><b>116.</b></span>
    that witches worke miracles. <i>Calvine</i> saith they are all ceased. All
    witchmongers saie they continue. But some affirme, that popish miracles
    are vanished and gone awaie: howbeit witches miracles remaine in full
    force. So as S. <i>Loy</i> is out of credit for a horsseleach, Maister
    <i>T.</i> and mother <i>Bungie</i> remaine in estimation for prophets: naie
    Hobgoblin and Robin goodfellow are contemned among yoong children, and
    mother <i>Alice</i> and mother <i>Bungie</i> are feared among old fooles. The
    estimation of these continue, bicause the matter hath not beene called
    in question: the credit of the other decaieth, bicause the matter hath
    beene looked into. Whereof I saie no more, but that S. <i>Anthonies</i>
    blisse will helpe/<span class="snp" id="p_158"><i>158.</i></span> your pig, whensoever mother <i>Bungie</i> dooth hurt it
    with hir cursse. And therefore we are warned by the word of God,<span class="sni">Prov. 51.</span> in
    anie wise not to feare their cursses. But let all the witchmongers,
    and speciallie the miraclemongers in the world answer me to this
    supposition; Put case that a woman of credit, or else a woman-witch
    should saie unto them, that she is a true prophet of the Lord, and that
    he revealeth those secret mysteries unto hir, whereby she detecteth the
    lewd acts and imaginations of the wicked, and that by him she worketh
    miracles, and prophesieth, &amp;c: I thinke they must either yeeld, or
    confesse that miracles are ceased. But such things (saith <i>Cardane</i>)<span class="sni"><i>H. Card. de miracul.</i></span>
    as seeme miraculous, are cheeflie doone by deceipt, legier-
    demaine, or confederacie; or else they maie
    be doone, and yet seeme unpossible,
    or else things are said to be
    done, and never were
    nor can be
    doone.</p>

    witches, nor the woman of <i>Endor</i>, nor yet hir familiar or divell
    can tell what is to come, may plainelie appeare by the words of the
    prophet,<span class="sni">Isai. 41.</span> who saith; Shew what things are to come, and we will saie you
    are gods indeed. According to that which <i>Salomon</i> saith; Who can tell
    a man what shall happen him under the sunne?<span class="sni">1 Sam. 28.<br />Rom. 12.<br />1.
    Cor. 12.<br />1. Pet. 1.</span> Marrie that can I (saith
    the witch of <i>Endor</i> to <i>Saule</i>.) But I will rather beleeve <i>Paule</i> and
    <i>Peter</i>, which saie, that prophesie is the gift of God, and no worldlie
    thing. Then a cousening queane,<span class="sni">[<i>del.</i> the full stop]</span> that taketh upon hir to doo all things,
    and can doo nothing but beguile men: up steppeth also mother <i>Bungie</i>,
    and she can tell you where your horsse or your asse is bestowed, or
    anie thing that you have lost is become, as <i>Samuell</i> could; and what
    you have doone in all your age past, as Christ did to the woman of
    <i>Sichar</i> at <i>Jacobs</i><span class="sni">John. 4.</span> well; yea and what your errand is, before you
    speake, as <i>Elizæus</i> did.</p>

  <p><i>Peter Martyr</i> saith, that onelie God and man knoweth the/<span class="snp" id="p_159"><i>159.</i></span> heart of
    man, and therefore, that the divell must be secluded,<span class="sni"><i>P.
    Martyr. loc. com. 9. sect. 17.</i></span> alledging these
    places; <i>Solus Deus est scrutator cordium</i>, Onelie God is the searcher
    of hearts. And, <i>Nemo scit quæ sunt hominis, nisi spiritus hominis
      qui est in eo</i>, None knoweth the things of man, but the spirit of man
    which is within him. And <i>Salomon</i> saith, <i>Tu solus nosti cogitationes
      hominum</i>, Thou onelie knowest the thoughts of men. And <i>Jeremie</i> saith
    in the person of God, <i>Ego Deus scrutans corda &amp; renes</i>, I am God
    searching hearts and reines. Also <i>Matthew</i> saith of Christ, <i>Jesus
      autem videns cogitationes eorum</i>, And Jesus seeing their thoughts, who
    in scripture is called the searcher and knower/<span class="snp"><b>117.</b></span> of the thoughts in the
    heart: as appeareth in <i>Acts</i>, 1. <i>&amp;</i> 15. <i>Rom.</i> 8. <i>Matth.</i> 9. 12.
    <i>&amp;</i> 22. <i>Marke.</i> 2. <i>Luke.</i> 6, <i>&amp;</i> 7. <i>&amp;</i> 11. <i>John.</i> 1. 2. 6. <i>&amp;</i> 13.
    <i>Apoc.</i> 2. <i>&amp;</i> 3. and in other places infinite.</p>

  <p>The same <i>Peter Martyr</i><span class="sni"><i>P. Martyr. in loc. comm.</i></span> also saith, that the divell maie suspect, but
    not know our thoughts: for if he should know our thoughts, he should
    understand our faith; which if he did, he would never assalt us with
    one temptation. Indeed we read that <i>Samuel</i> could tell where things
    lost were straied, &amp;c: but we see that gift also ceased by the comming
    of Christ, according to the saieng of <i>Paule</i>;
    <span class="sni">Hebr. 1, 8. &amp; 2.</span> At sundrie times, and in
    diverse maners God spake in the old times by our fathers the prophets,
    in these last daies he hath spoken unto us by his sonne, &amp;c. And
    therefore I saie that gift of prophesie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
    where- with God in times past
    endued his people, is also ceased, and counterfeits and couseners are
    come in their places, according to this saieng of <i>Peter</i>:<span class="sni">2. Pet. 2. 1.</span> There were
    false prophets among the people, even as there shalbe false teachers
    among you, &amp;c. And thinke not that so notable a gift should be taken
    from the beloved and elect people of God, and committed to mother
    <i>Bungie</i>, and such like of hir profession.</p>

  <p>The words of the prophet <i>Zacharie</i> are plaine, touching the ceasing
    both of the good and bad prophet,<span class="sni">Zach. 13.</span> to wit: I will cause the prophets
    and uncleane spirits to depart out of the land, and when anie shall
    yet prophesie, his parents shall saie to him; Thou shalt not live,
    for thou speakest lies in the name of the Lord: and his parents shall
    thrust him through when he prophesieth, &amp;c.<span class="sni"><i>J.
    Chrysost. in evang. Johan. hom. 18.<br />Pet. Blest. epist. 49.</i></span> No, no: the foretelling of
    things to come, is the onelie worke of God, who disposeth all things
    sweetlie, of whose counsell there hath never yet beene anie man. And to
    know our labours, the times/<span class="snp" id="p_160"><i>160.</i></span> and moments God hath placed in his owne
    power. Also <i>Phavorinus</i> saith, that if these cold prophets or oraclers
    tell thee prosperitie, and deceive thee, thou art made a miser through
    vaine expectation: if they tell thee of adversitie, &amp;c: and lie, thou
    art made a miser through vaine feare. And therefore I saie, we maie as
    well looke to heare prophesies at the tabernacle, in the bush, of the
    cherubin, among the clouds, from the angels, within the arke, or out of
    the flame, &amp;c: as to expect an oracle of a prophet in these daies.</p>

  <p>But put the case, that one in our common wealth should step up and saie
    he were a prophet (as manie frentike persons doo) who would beleeve
    him, or not thinke rather that he were a lewd person? See the statutes
    <i>Elizab.</i> 5.<span class="sni"><i>Canon. de. malef. &amp; mathemat.</i></span>
    whether there be not lawes made against them, condemning
    their arrogancie and cousenage: see also the canon lawes to the same
    effect.</p>

    oracles, which for the most part were idols of silver, gold,
    wood, stones, &amp;c:<span class="sni"><i>Thucidid. lib. 2.<br />Cicer.
    de. divin. lib. 2.</i></span> within whose bodies some saie uncleane spirites hid
    themselves, and gave answers: as some others saie, that exhalations
    rising out of the ground, inspire their minds, whereby their priests
    gave out oracles; so as spirits and winds rose up out of that soile,
    and indued those men/<span class="snp"><b>118.</b></span> with the gift of prophesie of things to come,
    though in truth they were all devises to cousen the people, and for
    the profit of preests, who received the idols answers over night, and
    delivered them backe to the idolaters the next morning: you shall
    understand, that although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
    it had beene so as it is supposed; yet by
    the reasons and proofes before rehearsed, they should now cease: and
    whatsoever hath affinitie with such miraculous actions, as witchcraft,
    conjuration, &amp;c: is knocked on the head, and nailed on the crosse
    with Christ, who hath broken the power of divels, and satisfied Gods
    justice,/<span class="snp" id="p_161"><i>161.</i></span> who also hath troden them under his feete, &amp; subdued them,
    &amp;c. At whose comming the prophet <i>Zacharie</i><span class="sni">Zach. 13, 2.</span> saith, that the Lord will
    cut the names of idols out of the land, and they shall be no more
    remembered; and he will then cause the prophets and uncleane spirits
    to depart out of the land. It is also written;<span class="sni">Mich. 5, 12.</span> I will cut off thine
    inchanters out of thine hand, and thou shalt have no more soothsaiers.
    And indeed the gospell of Christ hath so laid open their knaverie, &amp;c:
    that since the preaching thereof, their combes are cut, and few that
    are wise regard them. And if ever these prophesies came to take effect,
    it must be upon the cōming of Christ, whereat you see the divels were
    troubled and fainted, when they met him, saieng, or rather exclaming
    upon him on this wise; <i>Fili Dei cur venisti nos cruciare ante tempus?</i>
    O thou sonne of God, whie commest thou to molest us (or confound us)
    before our time appointed? Which he indeed prevented, and now remaineth
    he our defender and keeper from his clawes. So as now you see here is
    no roome left for such ghests.</p>

  <p>Howbeit, you shall heare the opinion of others, that have beene as much
    deceived as your selves in this matter: and yet are driven to confesse,
    that GOD hath constituted his sonne to beat downe the power of divels,
    and to satisfie Gods justice, and to heale our wound received by the
    fall of <i>Adam</i>, according to Gods promise in <i>Genesis.</i> 3.<span class="sni">Gen. 3.</span> The seed
    of the woman shall tread downe the serpent, or the divell. <i>Eusebius</i><span class="sni"><i>Euseb. lib. 5, cap. 1.</i></span>
    (in his fift booke <i>De prædicatione Evangelii</i>, the title whereof is
    this, that the power of divels is taken awaie by the comming of Christ)
    saith; All answers made by divels, all soothsaiengs and divinations
    of men are gon and vanished awaie. Item he citeth <i>Porphyrie</i><span class="sni"><i>Idem. Ibid.</i></span> in his
    booke against christian religion, wherein these words are rehearsed;<span class="sni"><i>Porphyr. in lib. contra christ. relig.</i></span>
    It is no mervell, though the plague be so hot in this citie: for ever
    since Jesus hath beene worshipped, we can obteine nothing that good is
    at the hands of our gods. And of this defection and ceasing of oracles
    writeth <i>Cicero</i><span class="sni"><i>Cic. de divin. lib. 2.<br />J.
    Chrysost. de laud.<br />Paul. hom 4.</i></span> long before, and that to have happened also before
    his time. Howbeit, <i>Chrysostome</i> living long since <i>Cicero</i>, saith,
    that <i>Apollo</i> was forced to grant, that so long as anie relike of a
    martyr was held to his nose, he could not make anie answer or oracle.
    So as one may perceive, that the heathen were wiser in this behalfe
    than manie christians, who in/<span class="snp" id="p_162"><i>162.</i></span> times past were called <i>Oppugnatores
    incantamentorum</i>, as the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
    princes are called <i>Defensores
    fidei</i>. <i>Plutarch</i> calleth <i>Bœotia</i> (as we call bablers) by the name
    of manie words, bicause of the multitude of oracles there, which now
    (saith he) are like to a spring or fountaine which is dried up. If
    anie one remained, I would ride five hundred miles to see it: but in
    the whole world/<span class="snp"><b>119.</b></span> there is not one to be seene at this houre; popish
    cousenages excepted.</p>

  <p>But <i>Plutarch</i><span class="sni"><i>Porphyr.</i> writeth verses in <i>Apollos</i> name, of the death of
    <i>Apollo</i>: cited by <i>J. Bod. fol. 6</i>.</span> saith, that the cause of this defection of oracles, was
    the divels death, whose life he held to be determinable and mortall,
    saieng they died for verie age; and that the divining preests were
    blowne up with a whirlewind, and soonke with an earthquake. Others
    imputed it to the site or the place of the planets, which when they
    passed over them, carried awaie that art with them, and by revolution
    may returne, &amp;c. <i>Eusebius</i> also citeth out of him the storie of <i>Pan</i>,
    which bicause it is to this purpose, I will insert the same; and since
    it mentioneth the divels death, you may beleeve it if you list: for
    I will not, as being assured that he is reserved alive to punish the
    wicked, and such as impute unto those idols the power of almightie God.</p>

    to <i>Paxe</i>. And whilest some slept, and others quaft, and othersome

    them that the great God <i>Pan</i> was departed. Whereat everie one was
    astonied (as <i>Epitherses</i> affirmed.) And being in consultation what

    which he had heard. But when they came to <i>Palodes</i>, and
    the wether calme, <i>Thamus</i> looking out toward the land, cried alowd,
    that the great god <i>Pan</i> was deceased: and immediatlie there followed
    a lamentable noise of a multitude of people, as it were with great
    woonder and admiration. And bicause there were manie in the ship, they
    said the fame thereof was speedilie brought to <i>Rome</i>, and <i>Thamus</i>
    sent for by <i>Tiberius</i> the Emperour, who gave such credit thereto, that
    he diligentlie inquired and asked, who that <i>Pan</i> was. The learned men
    about him supposed, that <i>Pan</i> was he who was the sonne of <i>Mercurie</i>
    and <i>Penelope</i>, &amp;c. <i>Eusebius</i> saith, that this chanced in the time of
    <i>Tiberius</i> the Emperor, when Christ expelled all divels, &amp;c.</p>

    in the yeare of <i>Tiberius</i> the nineteenth. Surelie, this was a merrie
    jest devised by <i>Thamus</i>,<span class="sni">A detection of Thamus
    his knaverie.</span> who with some confederate thought to make
    sport with the passengers, who were some asleepe, and some droonke, and
    some other at plaie, &amp;c: whiles the first voice was used. And at the
    second voice, to wit, when he should deliver his message, he being an
    old pilot, knew where some noise was usuall, by meanes of some eccho in
    the sea, and thought he would (to the astonishment of them) accomplish
    his devise, if the wether prooved calme. Whereby may appeare, that he
    would in other cases of tempests, &amp;c: rather attend to more serious
    busines, than to that ridiculous matter. For whie else should he not
    doo his errand in rough wether, as well as in calme? Or what need he
    tell the divell thereof, when the divell told it him before, and with
    much more expedition could have done the errand himselfe?</p>

    to knowe of hir safe deliverie: which thing she did. But the divell
    answered; Why praiest thou to me? I cannot helpe thee, but go praie to
    <i>Andrew</i> the apostle, and he may hel<span class="sni">A gentle
    and a godlie divell.</span>pe thy sister, &amp;c. Lo, this was
    not onelie a gentle, but a godlie divell, pittieng the womans case,
    who revealing his owne disabilitie, enabled S. <i>Andrew</i> more. I knowe
    some protestants will saie, that the divell, to mainteine idolatrie,
    &amp;c: referred the maid to S. <i>Andrew</i>. But what answer will the papists
    make, who thinke it great pietie to praie unto saints, and so by
    consequence honest courtesie in the divell, to send hir to S. <i>Andrew</i>,

    in <i>Delphos</i>, <i>Bœotia</i>, <i>Lycia</i>, and other places: but now since Christ
    is preached to all men, this madnesse is ceased. So as you see, that

    laid their plots, and made their confederacies aforehand, to beguile
    the world, to gaine monie, and to adde credit to their profession.
    This practise began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
    in the okes of <i>Dodona</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Strabo Geog. lib 16.<br />J.

    the trees thereof (they saie) could speake. And this was doone by a
    knave in a hollowe tree, that seemed sound unto the simple people. This
    wood was in <i>Molossus</i> a part of <i>Greece</i>, called <i>Epyrus</i>, and it was
    named <i>Dodonas</i> oracles. There were manie oracles in <i>Aegypt</i>; namelie,
    of <i>Hercules</i>, of <i>Apollo</i>, of <i>Minerva</i>, of <i>Diana</i>, of <i>Mars</i>, of
    <i>Jupiter</i>, and of the oxe <i>Apys</i>, who was the sonne of <i>Jupiter</i>, but
    his image was worshipped in the likenesse of an oxe. <i>Latona</i>, who
    was the mother of <i>Apollo</i>, was an oracle in the citie of <i>Bute</i>. The
    preests of <i>Apollo</i>, who alwaies counterfaited furie and madnesse,
    gave oracles in the temple called <i>Clarius</i>, within the citie of
    <i>Colophon</i> in <i>Greece</i>. At <i>Thebes</i> in <i>Bœotia</i> and also in <i>Læbadia</i>,
    <i>Trophonius</i> was the cheefe oracle. At <i>Memphis</i> a cow, at <i>Corinth</i> an
    oxe called <i>Mineus</i>, in <i>Arsinoe</i> a crocodile, in <i>Athens</i> a prophet
    called <i>Amphiaraus</i>, who/<span class="snp" id="p_166"><i>166.</i></span> indeed died at <i>Thebes</i>, where they saie the
    earth opened, &amp; swallowed him up quicke. At <i>Delphos</i> was the great
    temple of <i>Apollo</i>, where divels gave oracles by maides (as some saie)
    though indeed it was doone by preests. It was built upon <i>Parnassus</i>
    hill in <i>Greece</i>. And the defenders of oracles saie, that even as
    rivers oftentimes are diverted to another course; so likewise the
    spirit, which inspired the cheefe prophets, may for a time be silent,
    and revive againe by revolution.</p>

  <p><i>Demetrius</i> saith, that the spirits, which attended on oracles, waxed

    the blocks almightie lost their senses. For these are all gone now,
    and their knaverie is espied; so as they can no longer abuse the world
    with such bables. But whereas/<span class="snp"><b>122.</b></span> these great doctors suppose, that the
    cause of their dispatch was the comming of Christ; if they meane that
    the divell died, so soone as he was borne, or that then he gave over
    his occupation: they are deceived. For the popish church hath made a
    continuall practise hereof, partlie for their owne private profit,
    lucre, and gaine; and partly to be had in estimation of the world,
    and in admiration among the simple. But indeed, men that have learned
    Christ, and beene conversant in his word, have discovered and shaken
    off the vanitie and abhomination heereof. But if those doctors had
    lived till this daie, they would have said and written, that oracles
    had ceased, or rather beene driven out of <i>England</i><span class="sni">In
    whose daies oracles ceased in England</span> in the time of K.

    God by his word and wisedome had made the heavens, and placed

    for seasons, and for daies, and yeares. When he created the rainebowe
    in the clouds, he said it should be for a signe and token unto us.
    Which we find true, not onelie of the floud past, but also of shewers
    to come. And therefore according to Jesus <i>Sirachs</i> advise, let us
    behold it, and praise him that made it. The prophet <i>David</i><span class="sni">Ecclus.

    The heavens declare the glorie of God, and the firmament sheweth his
    handie worke: daie unto daie uttereth the same, and night unto night
    teacheth knowledge. It is also written that by the commandement of the
    holie one the starres are placed, and continue in their order, &amp; faile
    not in their watch. It should appeare, that Christ himselfe did not
    altogither neglect the course &amp; order of the heavens, in that he said;
    When you see a/<span class="snp" id="p_169"><i>169.</i></span> cloud rise out of the west, streight waie you saie a

    the morning you saie,<span class="sni">Matt. 16. 2, 3.</span> to daie shalbe a tempest, for the skie is red
    and lowring. Wherein as he noteth that these things doo trulie come to
    passe, according to ancient observation, and to the rule astronomicall:
    so doth he also by other words following admonish us, that in attending
    too much to those obsevations, we neglect not speciallie to follow our
    christian vocation.</p>

  <p>The physician is commended unto us, and allowed in the scriptures: but
    so to put trust in him, as to neglect &amp; distrust God, is severelie
    forbidden and reproved. Surelie it is most necessarie for us to know
    and observe diverse rules astrologicall; otherwise we could not with
    oportunitie dispatch our ordinarie affaires. And yet <i>Lactantius</i>

    Also they have noted, that one borne in the spring of the moone, shalbe

    learneth it out of the prophesies written in the scriptures, and by
    other nimble sleights, wherein he passeth anie other creature earthlie;
    and that the same divell, or some of his fellowes runnes or flies as

    or to some other idoll or witch, and there by waie of oracle answers
    all questions, through his understanding of the prophesies conteined
    in the old testament, especiallie in <i>Daniel</i> and <i>Esaie</i>: whereby
    the divell knew of the translation of the monarchie from <i>Babylon</i>
    to <i>Græcia</i>, &amp;c. But either they have learned this of some oracle
    or witch; or else I know not where the divell they find it.

    should appeare, that even of holie prophets there were diverse
    sorts. For <i>David</i> and <i>Salomon</i>, although in their psalmes and
    parables are conteined most excellent mysteries,<span class="sni">Diverse degrees of prophesie.</span> and notable
    allegories: yet they were not indued with that degree of prophesie,
    that <i>Elie</i> and <i>Elisha</i> were, &amp;c./<span class="snp"><b>127.</b></span> For as often as it is said, that
    God spake to <i>David</i> or <i>Salomon</i>, it is meant to be done by the
    prophets. For <i>Nathan</i> or <i>Gad</i> were the messengers and prophets to
    reveale Gods will to <i>David</i>.<span class="sni">2. Reg. 2.</span>
    And <i>Ahiam</i> the <i>Silonite</i> was sent from
    God to <i>Salomon</i>. Item, the spirit of prophesie, which <i>Elias</i> had,
    was doubled upon <i>Elisha</i>. Also some prophets prophesied all their
    lives, some had but one vision, and some had more, according to Gods
    pleasure; yea some prophesied unto the people of such things as came
    not to passe, and that was where Gods wrath was pacified by repentance.
    But these prophets were alwaies reputed among the people to be wise and
    godlie; whereas the heathen prophets were evermore knowne and said to
    be mad and foolish: as it is written both of the prophets of <i>Sibylla</i>,
    and also of <i>Apollo</i>; and at this daie also in the <i>Indies</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>But that anie of these extraordinarie gifts remaine at this daie,
    <i>Bodin</i>,<span class="sni"><i>J. Bodin.</i></span> nor anie witchmonger in the world shall never be able to
    proove: though he in his booke of divelish madnesse would make men

    Jewes, who were instructed by them of all such things as should come to
    passe; or else informed by <i>Urim</i>: so as the preests by the brightnes
    of the twelve pretious stones conteined therein, could prognosticate or
    expound anie thing. Which brightnes and vertue ceased (as <i>Josephus</i><span class="sni"><i>Joseph. de antiquit.</i></span>
    reporteth) two hundred yeares before he was borne. So as since that
    time, no answers were yelded thereby of Gods will and pleasure.
    Nevertheles, the Hebrues write,<span class="sni"><i>Josue filius<br />Levi. lib.<br />Pirkeaboth.</i></span> that there hath beene ever since that

    and his apostles prophesied of the calamities and afflictions,
    which shall greeve and disturbe the church of God in this life: also
    of the last daie, and of the signes and tokens that shall be shewed
    before that daie: and finallie of all things, which are requisite
    for us to foreknowe. Howbeit, such is the mercie of God, that all
    prophesies,<span class="sni">Prophesies conditionall.</span> threatnings, plagues, and punishments are annexed to
    conditions of repentance: as on the other side, corporall blessings are
    tied under the condition of the crosse and castigation. So as by them
    the mysteries of our salvation being discovered unto us, we are not to
    seeke new signes and miracles; but to attend to the doctrine of the
    apostles, who preached Christ exhibited and crucified for our sinnes,
    his resurrection, ascension, and thereby the redemption of as manie as
    beleeve, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The prophesies in the old testament treat of the continuance, the
    governement, and the difference of estates: of the distinction of
    the foure monarchies, of their order, decaie, and instauration;/<span class="snp" id="p_174"><i>174.</i></span> of
    the changes and/<span class="snp"><b>128.</b></span> ruines of the kingdomes of

    <i>Persia</i>, <i>Græcia</i>, <i>&amp;c</i>: and speciallie of the comming of our Saviour
    Jesus Christ; and how he should be borne of a virgine, and where, of
    his tribe, passion, resurrection, &amp;c. These prophesies were published
    by Gods speciall and peculiar prophets, endued with his particular
    and excellent gifts, according to his promise; I will raise them up a
    prophet out of the midst of their brethren, I will put my words in his
    mouth, &amp;c. Which though it were speciallie spoken of Christ, yet was
    it also spoken of those particular prophets, which were placed among
    them by God to declare his will; which were also figures of Christ the
    prophet himselfe. Now, if prophesie be an extraordinarie gift of God,
    and a thing peculiar to himselfe, as without whose speciall assistance
    no creature can be a prophet, or shew what is to come; whie should
    we beleeve, that those lewd persons can performe by divinations and
    miracles that which is not in humane but in divine power to accomplish?</p>

  <p>Howbeit, when I denie that witches can ride in the aire, and the
    miraculous circumstance thereof: by and by it is objected unto me, that<span class="sni">2. Reg. 2. 13.</span>
    <i>Enoch</i> and <i>Elie</i> were rapt into heaven bodilie; and that <i>Abacuke</i>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
    was carried in the aire, to feed <i>Daniel</i>: and so falselie oppose
    a divels or a witches power against the vertue of the Holy-ghost.
    If I deride the poets opinions, saieng, that witches cannot <i>Cœlo
    deducere lunam</i>, fetch the moone from heaven, &amp;c: they tell me that at
    <i>Joshuas</i> battell the sunne staied, and at the passion of Christ there
    was palpable darknes. If I denie their cunning in the exposition of
    dreames, advising them to remember <i>Jeremies</i> counsell, not to followe
    or credit the expositors of dreames; they hit me in the teeth with
    <i>Daniel</i> and <i>Joseph</i>: for that the one of them expounded <i>Pharao</i> the
    <i>Persian</i> kings, the other <i>Nabuchadnez-zar</i> the <i>Aegyptian</i> kings
    dreame. If I saie with <i>Salomon</i>,<span class="sni">Eccles. 9, 5.</span> that the dead knowe nothing, and
    that the dead knowe us not, neither are remooveable out of <i>Abrahams</i>
    bosome, &amp;c: they produce the storie of <i>Samuel</i>:<span class="sni">1. Sam. 28.</span> wherein, I saie,
    they set the power of a creature as high as the creator. If I saie,
    that these witches cannot transubstantiate themselves, nor others
    into beasts, &amp;c. they cite the storie of <i>Nabuchadnez-zar</i>; as though
    indeed he were made a materiall beast, and that also by witch/craft;<span class="snp" id="p_175"><i>175.</i></span>

    miracles expressed in the old testament were manie, but the end
    of them all was one, though they were divers and differing in shew:
    as where the sacrifices of <i>Moses</i>, <i>Elias</i>, and <i>Salomon</i>, being
    abundantlie wet were burnt with fier from heaven, &amp;c. The varietie
    of toongs at the building of <span class="sni">Gen. 11, 6.<br />Gen. 21.<br />Dan. 11.</span>
    <i>Babylon</i>, <i>Isaachs</i> birth of <i>Sarah</i>
    being by nature past children,/<span class="snp"><b>129.</b></span> the passage through the red sea,
    <i>Daniels</i> foretelling of the foure monarchies, in the fourth whereof
    he apparantlie foresheweth the comming of the Lord. All these, and
    manie other, which are expressed in the old testament, were mercifull
    instructions and notable miracles to strengthen the faith of Gods
    people in their Messias. If you had gone to <i>Delphos</i>, <i>Apollo</i> would
    have made you beleeve with his amphibologicall answers, that he could
    have foretold you all these things.</p>

  <p>The miracles wrought by Christ<span class="sni">A summe of Christs miracles.</span>
    were the raising up of the dead (which
    manie would impute to the woman of <i>Endor</i>, and also to our witches
    and conjurors) the restoring of the lame to lims, the blind to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> sight,
    the dumbe to speach, and finallie the healing of all diseases; which
    manie beleeve our witches can doo; yea, and as they themselves will
    take it upon them. As for casting out of divels (which was another kind
    of miracles usuall with Christ) witches and conjurors are said to be
    as good thereat as ever he was: and yet, if you will beleeve Christs
    words, it cannot be so. For he saith; Everie kingdome divided against
    it selfe,<span class="sni">Matt. 12. 25.</span> shall be brought to naught, &amp;c. If sathan cast out sathan, he
    is divided, &amp;c: and his kingdome shall not endure, &amp;c./</p>

  <p><span class="snp" id="p_176"><i>176.</i></span><i>Peters</i> chaines fell off in prison, so did <i>Richard Gallisies</i> fetters
    at <i>Windsor</i>: marrie the prison doores opened not to <i>Richard</i>, as they
    did to <i>Peter</i>. <i>Helias</i> by speciall grace obtained raine, our witches
    can make it raine, when they list, &amp;c. But sithens Christ did these

    our faith, and finallie for the conversion of the people (as appeareth

    all the miracles expressed in the old and new testament; which are of more

    braine, whilest the bodie is occupied with sleepe: for as touching the

    that the divell both by daie and also by night, travelleth to seduce
    man, and to lead him from God; yea and that no waie more than this,
    where he placeth himselfe as God in the minds of them that are so

    in the office, nature, and power of God to accomplish.</p>

    onelie that knoweth such secrets, as in the exposition of dreames is
    required? And doth not <i>Joseph</i><span class="sni">Gen. 11, 8.<br />Gen.
    37, &amp; 11.<br />Isai. 11.<br />Dan. 2.</span> repeat those verie words to <i>Pharaos</i>
    officers, who consulted with him therein? Examples of divine dreames
    you maie find a great number in the scripture, such (I meane) as it
    pleased God to reveale his pleasure by. Of physicall dreames we maie
    both read in authors, and see in our owne experience dailie, or rather
    nightly. Such dreams also as are casuall, they are likewise usuall,
    and come (as hath beene said) through the multitude of affaires
    and businesse. Those which in these daies are called magicall or
    diabolicall dreames, maie rather be called melancholicall. For out of
    that blacke vapor in sleepe, through dreames, appeareth (as <i>Aristotle</i>
    <span class="sni"><i>Aristot. de somnio.</i></span>
    saith) some horrible thing; and as it were the image of an ouglie
    divell: sometimes also other terrible visions, imaginations, counsels,
    and practises. As where we read of a certeine man, that dreamed there
    appeared one unto him that required him to throwe himselfe into a deepe
    pit, and that he should reape great benefit thereby at Gods hands.
    So as the miserable wretch giving credit thereunto, performed the
    matter, and killed himselfe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
    Now I confesse, that the interpretation
    or execution of that dreame was indeed diabolicall: but the dreame was
    casuall, derived from the heavie and blacke humor of melancholie./</p>

    <i>Minerva</i>, &amp;c: are but fables; and then do they lie that mainteine
    those actions to be doone in deed and veritie, which in truth are doone
    no waie. It were marvell on the one side (if those things happened
    in dreames, which neverthelesse the witches affirme to be otherwise)
    that when those witches awake, they neither consider nor remember that
    they were in a dreame. <span class="sni"><i>Barthol. Spinæus, q. de strigib.

    are inquisitors, should have such operation. It were marvell that their
    ointments cannot be found anie where, saving onelie in the inquisitors
    bookes. It were marvell, that when a stranger is annointed therewith,
    they have sometimes, and yet not alwaies, the like operation as with
    witches; which all the inquisitors confesse.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

  <p>But to this last, frier <span class="sni"><i>Bar. Spin. qu. de strigib.

    themselves, before they annoint themselves, do heare in the night time
    a great noise of minstrels, which flie over them, with the ladie of the
    fairies, and then they addresse themselves to their journie. But then
    I marvell againe, that no bodie else heareth nor seeth this troope of
    minstrels, especiallie riding in a moone light night. It is marvell
    that they that thinke this to be but in a dreame, can be persuaded that
    all the rest is anie other than dreames.<span class="sni">New matter &amp;

    murthers, and receive ointments, roots, powders, &amp;c: (as witchmongers
    report they doo, and as they make the witches confesse) and yet lie at
    home fast asleepe. It is marvell that such preparation is made for them
    (as <i>Sprenger</i>, <i>Bartholomew</i>, and <i>Bodin</i> report) as well in noble
    mens houses, as in alehouses; and that they come in dreames, and eate
    up their meate: and the alewife speciallie is not wearied with them for

    monie, which they saie is not substantiall, and that they talke not
    afterwards about the reckoning, and so discover the matter. And it
    is most marvell of all, that the hostesse, &amp;c: dooth not sit among
    them, and take part of their good cheere. For so it is, that if any
    part of these their meetings and league be true, it is as true and as
    certeinlie prooved and confessed, that at some alehouse, or sometime at

    is held and mainteined by divers, and gathered out of the 12. of
    <i>Numbers</i>, that all which was written or spoken by the prophets, among
    the children of Israel (<i>Moses</i> excepted) was propounded to them by
    dreames. And indeed it is manifest, that manie things, which are
    thought by the unlearned to have beene reallie finished, have beene
    onlie performed by dreams and visions. As where <i>Salomon</i><span class="sni">1. Re. 3, 5. 15.</span> required of
    God the gift of wisdome: that was (I say) in a dreame; and also where
    he received promise<span class="sni">1. Reg. 9.</span> of the continuance of the kingdome of Israel in
    his line. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
    was <i>Esais</i><span class="sni">Isai. 6.<br />Ezech. 12.<br />Jerem. 13.</span>
    vision in the 6. of his prophesie: as also
    that of <i>Ezechiel</i> the 12. Finallie, where <i>Jeremie</i> was commanded to
    hide his girdle in the clift of a rocke at the river <i>Euphrates</i> in
    <i>Babylon</i>; and that after certeine daies, it did there putrifie, it
    must needs be in a dreame; for <i>Jeremie</i> was never (or at leastwise not
    then) at <i>Babylon</i>. We that are christians must not now slumber and
    dreame, but watch and praie, and meditate upon our salvation in Christ
    both daie and night. And if we expect revelations in our dreames,
    now, when Christ is come, we shall deceive our selves: for in him are
    fulfilled all dreames and prophesies. Howbeit, <i>Bodin</i><span class="sni"><i>J.
    Bodin. lib. de dæmon. 1. cap. 5.</i></span> holdeth that
    dreames and visions continue till this daie, in as miraculous maner as
    ever they did.</p>

  <p>If you read <i>Artemidorus</i>, you shall read manie stories of such as
    drempt of things that afterwards cam to passe. But he might have
    cited a thousand for one that fell out contrarie: for as for/<span class="snp" id="p_188"><i>188.</i></span> such
    dreamers among the Jews themselves, as had not extraordinarie visions
    miraculouslie exhibited unto them by God, they were counted couseners,
    as may appeere by these words of the prophet <i>Zacharie</i>;<span class="sni">Zach. 10, 2.</span> Surelie the
    idols have spoken vanitie, and the soothsaiers have seene a lie,
    and the dreamers have told a vaine thing. According to <i>Salomons</i><span class="sni">Eccles. 5, 6.<br />Jerem. 23.</span>
    saieng; In the multitude of dreames and vanities are manie words.
    It appeereth in <i>Jeremie</i> 23. that the false prophets, whilest they
    illuded the people with lies, counterfetting the true prophets, used
    to crie out; Dreames, dreames; We have dreamed a dreame, &amp;c. Finallie,
    <i>Nabuchadnez-zar</i> teacheth all men to knowe a
    true expositor of dreames; to wit, such a one as hath his
    revelation from GOD. For he can (as <i>Daniel</i><span class="sni">Daniel. 2.</span> did)
    repeate your dreame before you discover it:
    which thing if anie expounder of

    touching the element of fier, &amp; the superstition therof about those

    nations have received, reverenced, &amp; reserved fier, as the most holy
    thing among their sacrifices: insomuch (I saie) as they have worshipped
    it a/mong<span class="snp" id="p_192"><i>192.</i></span> their gods, calling it <i>Orimasda</i> (to wit) holie fier, and
    divine light. The Greekes called it ἑσίαν, the Romans <i>Vesta</i>, which
    is, The fier of the Lord. Surelie they had heard of the fier that came
    downe from heaven, and consumed the oblations of the fathers; and
    they understood it to be God himselfe. For there came to the heathen,
    the bare names of things, from the doctrine of the godlie fathers and
    patriarchs, and those so ob/scured<span class="snp"><b>140.</b></span> with fables, and corrupted with
    lies, so overwhelmed with superstitions, and disguised with ceremonies,
    that it is hard to judge from whence they came. Some cause thereof (I
    suppose) was partlie the translations of governements, whereby one
    nation learned follie of another; and partlie blind devotion, without
    knowledge of Gods word: but speciallie the want of grace, which they
    sought not for, according to Gods commandement and will. And that the
    Gentiles had some inkling of the godlie fathers dooings, may diverslie

    <i>Romans</i>, even after they were growne to great civilitie, and
    enjoied a most flourishing state and commonwealth, would sometimes
    sacrifice themselves, sometimes their children, sometimes their
    friends, &amp;c: consuming the same with fier, which they thought holie.
    Such estimation (I saie) was attributed to this art of divination upon
    the entrails of beasts, &amp;c: at <i>Rome</i>, as the cheefe princes themselves
    exercised the same; namelie,/<span class="snp" id="p_193"><i>193.</i></span> <i>Romulus</i>, <i>Fabius Maximus</i>, <i>&amp;c</i>: in so much
    as there was a decree made there, by the whole senate, that six of
    the cheefe magistrats sonnes should from time to time be put foorth,
    to learne the mysterie of these arts of augurie and divination, at
    <i>Hetruria</i>, where the cunning and knowledge thereof most abounded.
    When they came home well informed and instructed in this art, their
    estimation and dignitie was such, as they were accounted, reputed, and
    taken to be the interpreters of the gods, or rather betweene the gods
    and them. No high preest, nor anie other great officer was elected, but
    these did either absolutelie nominate them, or else did exhibit the

    the effect of which words is this; Let all prodigious and portentous

    and speciallie of the professors of them, which are and alwaies have

    ascribing unto themselves his omnipotent power, to foretell, &amp;c:
    whereas, in truth, they could or can doo nothing, but make a shew of
    that which is not.</p>

  <p>One matter,<span class="sni">A manifest discoverie of augurors cousenage.</span> to bewraie their cousening, is; that they could never worke
    nor foreshew anie thing to the poore or inferior sort of people: for

    matters as touched the baser sort, were inferior causes; which the

    Howbeit, the professors of this art descended not so lowe, as to
    communicate with them: for they were preests (which in all ages and
    nations have beene jollie fellowes) whose office was, to tell what
    should come to passe, either touching good lucke, or bad fortune; to
    expound the minds, admonitions, warnings and

    to foreshew calamities, &amp;c: which might be (by their sacrifices and
    common contrition) remooved and qualified. And before their entrance
    into that action, they had manie observations, which they executed
    verie superstitiouslie; pretending that everie bird and beast, &amp;c.,
    should be sent from the gods as foreshewes of somewhat. And/<span class="snp" id="p_195"><i>195.</i></span> therefore
    first they used to choose a cleare daie, and faire wether to doo their
    busines in: for the which their place was certeinelie assigned, as well

    the letters, numbers, figures, things and armes, the prickes over the

    One told <i>Cato</i>, that a rat had carried awaie and eaten his hose, which
    the partie said was a woonderfull signe. Naie (said <i>Cato</i>) I thinke

    to fight with pies. In the like case also he answered <i>Labienus</i>, who

    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> of things
    to come; <i>Ergo</i>, they doo not thereby foretell things trulie, but by

    my freends comming, than the chattering of a pie.</p>

  <p>When <i>Hanibal</i> overthrew <i>Marcus Marcellus</i>, the beast sacrificed
    wanted a peece of his hart; therefore forsooth <i>Marius</i>, when he

    have the like successe. These are their collections, and as vaine, as

    <span class="sni"><i>August. lib. de doct. chri. 2. cap. 2.</i><br />Psal. 4, 2.</span>
    saith, that these observations are most superstitious. But we read in

    this follie and impietie; O ye sonnes of men, how long will you turne
    my glorie into shame, loving vanitie, and seeking lies? The like is

    ill part, ill lucke/<span class="snp"><b>151.</b></span> followeth; if we neglect them, and wey them not,
    they doo neither good nor harme. <i>Thomas</i> of <i>Aquine</i> reasoneth in this

    more plainly derided in the scriptures, than any other follie. And

    inconstant, that few writers agree in/<span class="snp"><b>153.</b></span> the verie principles therof. For
    the <i>Rabbins</i>, the old and new writers, and the verie best philosophers
    dissent in the cheefe grounds thereof, differing in the proprietie of
    the houses, whereout they wring the foretelling of things to come,
    contending even about the number of spheres, being not yet resolved how
    to erect the beginnings and endes of the houses: for <i>Ptolomie</i> maketh

    is it possible to find out the true entring of the sunne into the
    equinoctiall points. It is not denied, that the astronomers
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span> themselves
    have received their light, and their verie art from poets, without
    whose fables the twelve signes and the northerlie and southerlie

    astrologers doo live, cousen men, and game by these fables; whiles the
    poets, which are the inventors of them, doo live in beggerie.</p>

  <p>The verie skilfullest mathematicians confesse, that it is unpossible to
    find out anie certeine thing concerning the knowledge of judgements, as
    well for the innumerable causes which worke togither with the heavens,
    being all togither, and one with the other to be considered: as also
    bicause influencies doo not constraine but incline. For manie ordinarie
    and extraordinarie occasions doo interrupt them; as education, custome,
    place, honestie, birth, bloud, sicknesse, health, strength, weakenes,
    meate, drinke, libertie of mind, learning, &amp;c. And they that have
    written the rules of judgement, and agree neerest therein, being of
    equall authoritie and learning, publish so contrarie opinions upon
    one thing, that it is unpossible for an astrologian to pronounce a
    certeintie upon so variable opinions; &amp; otherwise, upon so uncerteine
    reports no man is able to judge herein. So as (according to <i>Ptolomie</i>)
    the foreknowledge of things to come by the starres, dependeth as
    well upon the affections of the mind, as upon the observation of the
    planets, proceeding rather from chance than art, as whereby they

    with anie they be discontent, they saie the starres be not favourable
    to them, and threaten them with hanging, drowning, beggerie, sickenes,

    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span> prognostications fall out right,
    then they triumph above measure. If the prognosticators be found to
    forge and lie alwaies (without such fortune as the blind man had in

    dominatur astris</i>, wheras (according to <i>Agrippas</i> words) neither the
    wiseman ruleth the starres, nor the starres the wiseman, but God ruleth
    them both. <i>Corn. Tacitus</i> saith, that they are a people disloiall to
    princes, deceiving them that beleeve them. And <i>Varro</i> saith, that the
    vanitie of all superstitions floweth out of the bosome of astrologie.
    And if our life &amp; fortune depend not on the starres, then it is to be
    granted, that the astrologers seeke where nothing is to be found. But
    we are so fond, mistrustfull &amp; credulous, that we feare more the fables

    is, the more we stand in feare thereof; and the lesse likelie to be
    true, the more/<span class="snp" id="p_213"><i>213.</i></span> we beleeve it. And if we were not such, I thinke with
    <i>Cornelius Agrippa</i>, that these divinors, astrologers, conjurors, and
    cousenors would die for hunger.</p>

  <p>And our foolish light beleefe, forgetting things past, neglecting
    things present, and verie hastie to know things to come, doth so
    comfort and mainteine these cousenors; that whereas in other men, for
    making one lie, the faith of him that speaketh is so much mistrusted,
    that all the residue being true is not regarded. Contrariwise, in these
    cousenages among our divinors, one truth spoken by hap giveth such
    credit to all their lies, that ever after we beleeve whatsoever they
    saie; how incredible, impossible or false soever it be. Sir <i>Thomas

    our side; to wit, If the cheefe and principall lawes of the world be
    in this case ridiculous, vaine, false, incredible, yea and contrarie
    to Gods lawe; the residue of the lawes and arguments to that effect,
    are to be suspected. If that argument should hold, it might proove all
    the popish lawes against protestants, &amp; the hea/thenish<span class="snp"><b>159.</b></span> princes lawes
    against christians, to be good and in force: for it is like they would
    not have made them, except they had beene good. Were it not (thinke
    you) a strange proclamation, that no man (upon paine of death) should
    pull the moone out of heaven?<span class="sni"><i>J. Bodinus.<br />Danæus.<br />Hyperius.<br />Heming.<br />

    witchmongers make their arguments upon weaker grounds; as namelie in
    this forme and maner; We find in poets, that witches wrought such and
    such miracles; <i>Ergo</i> they can accomplish and doo this or that wonder.
    The words of the lawe are these;/<span class="snp" id="p_221"><i>221.</i></span>
    <i>Qui fruges incantasset pœnas dato, Néve alienam segetem pellexeris
    excantando, neq́; incantando, Ne agrum defruganto</i>: the sense
    wherof in English is this; Let him be executed that
    bewitcheth corne, Transferre not other mens
    corne into thy ground by inchantment,
    Take heede thou inchant not at all
    neither make thy neighbors

    among us, we thinke them bewitched that wax suddenlie poore,
    and not them that growe hastilie rich; yet at <i>Rome</i> you shall
    understand, that (as <i>Plinie</i><span class="sni">A notable purgation of C. F. C. convented for a witch.</span>
    reporteth) upon these articles one <i>C.
    Furius Cressus</i> was convented before <i>Spurius Albinus</i>; for that he
    being but a little while free, and delivered from bondage, occupieng
    onelie tillage; grew rich on the sudden, as having good crops: so as
    it was suspected that he transferred his neighbors corne into his
    fields. None intercession, no delaie, none excuse, no deniall would
    serve, neither in jest nor derision, nor yet through sober or honest
    meanes: but he was assigned a peremptorie daie, to answer for life. And
    therefore fearing the sentence of condemnation, which was to be given
    there, by the voice and verdict of three men (as we heere are tried by
    twelve) made his appearance at the daie assigned, and brought with him
    his ploughs and harrowes, spades and shovels, and other instruments of
    husbandrie, his oxen, horsses, and working bullocks, his servants, and
    also his daughter, which was a sturdie wench and a good huswife, and
    also (as <i>Piso</i> reporteth) well trimmed up in apparell, and said to the
    whole bench in this wise; Lo heere my lords I make mine appearance,
    according to my promise and your pleasures, presenting unto you my
    charmes and witchcrafts, which have so inriched me. As for the labour,
    sweat, wat/ching,<span class="snp" id="p_222"><i>222.</i></span> care, and diligence, which I have used in this
    behalfe, I cannot shew you them at this time. And by this meanes he
    was dismissed by the consent of that court, who otherwise (as it was
    thought) should hardly have escaped the sentence of condemnation, and
    punishment of death.</p>

  <p>It is constantlie affirmed in <i>M. Mal.</i><span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef.
    par. 2. quæ. 1. cap. 5.</i></span> that <i>Stafus</i> used alwaies to
    hide himselfe in a *monshoall,<span class="sni">[* moushoall]</span> and had a disciple called <i>Hoppo</i>,
    who made <i>Stadlin</i> a maister witch, and could all when they list

    with thunder and lightning; and kill children, cattell, &amp;c: reveale
    things hidden, and many other tricks, when and where they list. But
    these two shifted not so well with the inquisitors, as the other with
    the <i>Romane</i> and heathen judges. Howbeit, <i>Stafus</i> was too hard for
    them all: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>for none of all the lawiers nor inquisitors could bring him

    see in these verses, the poets (whether in earnest or in jest I
    know not) ascribe unto witches &amp; to their charmes, more than is to be
    found in humane or diabolicall power. I doubt not but the most part
    of the readers hereof will admit them to be fabulous; although the
    most learned of mine adversaries (for lacke of scripture) are faine to
    produce these poetries for proofes, and for lacke of judgement I am
    sure doo thinke, that <i>Actæons</i><span class="sni"><i>Ovid Metamorph. lib. 3. fab. 2.</i></span> transformation was true. And why not?
    As well as the metamorphosis or transubstantiation of <i>Ulysses</i> his

    Metamorph. 14. fab. 5, 6.</i></span> and so manie great clarkes
    credit and report.</p>

  <p>Neverthelesse, popish writers (I confesse) have advantage herein of
    our protestants: for (besides these poeticall proofes) they have
    (for advantage) the word and authoritie of the pope himselfe, and
    others of that/<span class="snp"><b>166.</b></span> holie crue; whose charmes, conjurations, blessings,
    curssings, &amp;c: I meane in part (for a tast) to set downe; giving you
    to understand, that poets are not altogither so impudent as papists
    herein, neither seeme they so ignorant, prophane, or impious.<span class="sni">The
    authors transition to his purposed scope.</span> And
    therefore I will shew you how lowd also they lie, and what they on the
    other side ascribe to their charmes and conjurations; and togither will
    set downe with them all maner of witches charmes, as convenientlie as I

  <h4>¶ <i>A charme against shot, or a wastcote of proofe.</i></h4>

  <p class="drop-cap">BEfore the comming up of these <i>Agnus Deis</i>, a holie garment called
    a wastcote for necessitie was much used of our forefathers, as a
    holy relike, &amp;c: as given by the pope, or some such archconjuror,
    who promised thereby all manner of immunitie to the wearer thereof;
    in somuch as he could not be hurt with anie shot or other violence.
    And otherwise, that woman that would weare it, should have quicke
    deliverance: the composition thereof was in this order following.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The maner of making a wastecote of proofe.</span>
    On Christmas daie at night, a threed must be sponne of flax, by a
    little virgine girle, in the name of the divell: and it must be by
    hir woven, and also wrought with the needle. In the brest or forepart
    thereof must be made with needle worke two heads; on the head at the
    right side must be a hat, and a long beard; the left head must have on
    a crowne, and it must be so horrible, that it maie resemble Belzebub,
    and on each side of the wastcote must be made a crosse.</p>

    saith, that if there be added hereunto an <i>Agnus Dei</i>, and the same be

    doth saie, that for somuch as by no diet nor physicke anie disease
    can be so taken awaie or extinguished, but that certeine dregs and
    relikes will remaine: therefore physicians use physicall alligations,
    appensions, periapts, amulets, charmes, characters, &amp;c., which he
    supposeth maie doo good; but harme he is sure they can doo none:
    urging that it is necessarie and expedient for a physician to leave
    nothing undone that may be devised for his patients recoverie; and
    that by such meanes manie great cures are done. He citeth a great
    number of experiments out of <i>Alexander Trallianus</i>, <i>Aetius</i>,
    <i>Octavianus</i>, <i>Marcellus</i>, <i>Philodotus</i>, <i>Archigines</i>, <i>Philostratus</i>,
    <i>Plinie</i>, and <i>Dioscorides</i>; and would make men beleeve that <i>Galen</i>
    (who in truth despised and derided all those vanities) recanted in
    his latter daies his former opinion, and all his invectives tending
    against these magicall cures: writing also a booke intituled <i>De
    Homerica medicatione</i>, which no man could ever see, but one <i>Alexander
    Trallianus</i>, who saith he saw it:/<span class="snp" id="p_240"><i>240.</i></span> and further affirmeth, that it is
    an honest mans part to cure the sicke, by hooke or by crooke, or by
    anie meanes whatsoever. Yea he saith that <i>Galen</i> (who indeed wrote
    and taught that <i>Incantamenta sunt muliercularum figmenta</i>, and be
    the onlie clokes of bad physicians) affirmeth, that there is vertue
    and great force in incantations.<span class="sni">This would be examined, to see if Galen be not slandered.</span> As for example (saith <i>Trallian</i>)
    <i>Galen</i> being now reconciled to this opinion, holdeth and writeth,
    that the bones which sticke in ones throte, are avoided and cast
    out with the violence of charmes and inchanting words; yea and that
    thereby the stone, the chollicke, the falling sicknes, and all fevers,
    gowts, fluxes, fistulas, issues of bloud, and finallie whatsoever cure
    (even beyond the skill of himselfe or anie other foolish physician)
    is cured and perfectlie healed by words of inchantment. Marie M.
    <i>Ferrarius</i> (although he allowed and practised this kind of physicke)
    yet he protesteth that he thinketh it none otherwise effectuall, than
    by the waie of constant opinion: so as he affirmeth that neither the

    cure; as (saith he) the experiment of the toothach will manifestlie

    the vanitie of these superstitious trifles more largelie hereafter. And
    therefore at this time I onelie saie, that those amulets, which are
    to be hanged or carried about one, if they consist of hearbs, rootes,
    stones, or some other metall, they maie have diverse medicinable
    operations; and by the vertue given to them by God in their creation,
    maie worke strange effects and cures: and to impute this vertue to
    anie other matter is witchcraft. And whereas <i>A. Ferrarius</i> commendeth
    certeine amulets, that have no shew of physicall operation; as a naile
    taken from a crosse, holie water, and the verie signe of the crosse,
    with such like popish stuffe: I thinke he laboureth thereby rather to
    draw men to poperie, than to teach or persuade them in the truth of
    physicke or philosophie. And I thinke thus the rather, for that he
    himselfe seeth the fraud hereof; confessing that where these magicall
    physicians applie three seeds of three leaved grasse to a tertian ague,
    and foure to a quartane, that the number is not materiall.</p>

    whereof amulets, characters, &amp; charmes are three: howbeit he commendeth

    in illusions, which he more properlie calleth stratagems. Of which sort
    of conclusions he alledgeth for example, how <i>Philodotus</i> did put a
    cap of lead upon ones head, who imagined he was headlesse, whereby the
    partie was delivered from his disease or conceipt. Item another cured a
    woman that imagined, that a serpent or snake did continuallie gnaw
    and/<span class="snp" id="p_242"><i>242.</i></span> teare hir entrailes; and that was done onelie by giving hir a vomit,
    and by foisting into the matter vomited a little serpent or snake, like
    unto that which she imagined was in hir bellie.</p>

  <p>Item,<span class="sni">The force of fixed fansie, opinion, or strong conceipt.</span> another imagined that he alwaies burned in the fier, under
    whose bed a fier was privilie conveied, which being raked out before

    perteineth, that the hickot is cured with sudden feare or strange

    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_c.png" width="75" height="75" alt='C' /></span>ONCERNING
    the charming of serpents and snakes, mine adversaries (as I
    have said) thinke they have great advantage by the words of <i>David</i> in
    the fiftie eight psalme; and by <i>Jeremie</i>, chapter eight, expounding
    the one prophet by <i>Virgil</i>, the other by <i>Ovid</i>. For the words of
    <i>David</i><span class="sni">Psal. 58.</span> are these; Their poison is like the poison of a serpent, and
    like a deafe adder, that stoppeth his/<span class="snp" id="p_250"><i>250.</i></span> eare, and heareth not the voice
    of the charmer, charme he never so cunninglie. The words of <i>Virgil</i><span class="sni"><i>Virg. eclog. 8.</i></span>
    are these, <i>Frigidus in pratis cantando rumpitur anguis</i>. As he might
    saie, <i>David</i> thou liest; for the cold natured snake is by the charmes
    of the inchanters broken all to peeces in the field where he lieth.
    Then commeth <i>Ovid</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Ovid. metamor. 7.</i></span> and he taketh his countriemans part, saieng in the
    name and person of a witch; <i>Vipereas rumpo verbis &amp; carmine fauces</i>;
    that is, I with my words and charmes can breake in sunder the vipers
    jawes. Marrie <i>Jeremie</i><span class="sni">Jerem. 8. 17.</span> on the other side encountereth this poeticall
    witch, and he not onelie defendeth, but expoundeth his fellowe prophets
    words, and that not in his owne name, but in the name of almightie God;
    saieng, I will send serpents and cockatrices among you, which cannot be
    charmed.</p>

  <p>Now let anie indifferent man (christian or heathen) judge, whether
    the words and minds of the prophets doo not directlie oppugne these
    poets words (I will not saie minds:) for that I am sure they did
    therein but jest and trifle, according to the common fabling of lieng
    poets. And certeinlie, I can encounter them two with other two poets;
    namelie <i>Propertius</i> and <i>Horace</i>, the one merrilie deriding, the other
    seriouslie impugning their fantasticall poetries, concerning the power
    and omnipotencie of witches. For where <i>Virgil</i>, <i>Ovid</i>, <i>&amp;c</i>: write
    that witches with their charmes fetch downe the moone and starres from
    heaven, etc.; <i>Propertius</i> mocketh them in these words following:/</p>

  <p>As for <i>Horace</i> his verses I omit them, bicause I have cited them in
    another place. And concerning this matter <i>Cardanus</i><span class="sni"><i>Card.
    lib. 15. de var. rer. cap. 80.</i></span> saith, that at
    everie eclipse they were woont to thinke, that witches pulled downe the
    sunne and moone from heaven. And doubtles, hence came the opinion of
    that matter, which spred so farre, and continued so long in the common
    peoples mouthes, that in the end learned men grew to beleeve it, and to
    affirme it in writing.</p>

  <p>But here it will be objected,<span class="sni">An objection answered.</span> that bicause it is said (in the places
    by me alledged) that snakes or vipers cannot be charmed; <i>Ergo</i> other
    things may: To answer this argument, I would aske the witchmonger
    this question, to wit; Whether it be expedient, that to satisfie his
    follie, the Holie-ghost must of necessitie make mention of everie
    particular thing that he imagineth may be bewitched? I would also aske
    of him, what privilege a snake hath more than other creatures, that he
    onelie may not, and all other creatures may be bewitched?
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span> I hope they
    will not saie, that either/<span class="snp"><b>182.</b></span> their faith or infidelitie is the cause
    thereof; neither doo I admit the answer of such divines as saie, that
    he cannot be bewitched:/<span class="snp" id="p_252"><i>252.</i></span> for that he seduced <i>Eve</i>; by meanes whereof
    God himselfe curssed him; and thereby he is so privileged, as that no
    witches charme can take hold of him. But more shall be said hereof in
    the sequele.</p>

  <p><i>Danæus</i><span class="sni"><i>Dan. in dialog. cap. 3.</i></span>
    saith, that witches charmes take soonest hold upon snakes
    and adders; bicause of their conference and familiaritie with the
    divell, whereby the rather mankind through them was seduced. Let us
    seeke then an answer for this cavill; although in truth it needeth
    not: for the phrase of speach is absolute, &amp; importes not a speciall
    qualitie proper to the nature of a viper anie more, than when I saie;
    A connie cannot flie: you should gather &amp; conclude thereupon, that I
    ment that all other beasts could flie. But you shall understand, that
    the cause why these vipers can rather withstand the voice &amp; practise of
    inchanters and sorcerers, than other creatures, is: for that they being
    in bodie and nature venomous, cannot so soone or properlie receive
    their destruction by venome, wherby the witches in other creatures
    bring their mischeefous practises more easilie to passe, according to
    <i>Virgils</i> saieng</p>

  <div class="poetry">

  <p>And thereupon the prophet alludeth unto their corrupt and inflexible
    nature, with that comparison: and not (as <i>Tremelius</i> is faine to shift
    it) with stopping one eare with his taile, and laieng the other close
    to the ground; bicause he would not heare the charmers voice. For the
    snake hath neither such reason; nor the words such effect: otherwise
    the snake must know our thoughts. It is also to be considered, how
    untame by nature these vipers (for the most part) are; in so much as
    they be not by mans industrie or cunning to be made familiar, or traind
    to doo anie thing, whereby admiration maie be procured: as <i>Bomelio

    Holie-ghost came and told him a tale in his eare: the same pigeon also
    brought him a scroll, wherein was written, <i>Rex esto</i>, and laid the

    will be bold to trouble you but with one more.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span></p>

  <p>At <i>Memphis</i> in <i>Aegypt</i>,<span class="sni">A storie declaring
    the great docilitie of an asse.</span> among other juggling knacks, which were there
    usuallie shewed, there was one that tooke such paines with an asse,
    that he had taught him all these qualities following. And for gaine
    he caused a stage to be made, and an assemblie of people to meete;
    which being done, in the maner of a plaie, he came in with his asse,
    and said; The <i>Sultane</i> hath great need of asses to helpe to carrie
    stones and other stuffe, towards his great building which he hath in
    hand. The asse im/mediatlie<span class="snp"><b>183.</b></span> fell downe to the ground, and by all signes
    shewed himselfe to be sicke, and at length to give up the ghost: so
    as the juggler begged of the assemblie monie towards his losse. And
    having gotten all that he could, he said; Now my maisters, you shall
    see mine asse is yet alive, and dooth but counterfet; bicause he would
    have some monie to buie him provender, knowing that I was poore, and
    in some need of releefe. Hereupon he would needs laie a wager, that
    his asse was alive, who to everie mans seeming was starke dead. And
    when one had laid monie with him thereabout, he commanded the asse
    to rise, but he laie still as though he were dead: then did he beate
    him with a cudgell, but that would not serve the turne, untill he
    addressed this speech to the asse, saieng (as before) in open audience;
    The <i>Sultane</i> hath commanded, that all the people shall ride out to
    morrow, and see the triumph, and that the faire ladies will then ride
    upon the fairest asses, and will give notable provender unto them, and
    everie asse shall drinke of the sweete water of <i>Nilus</i>: and then lo
    the asse did presentlie start up, and advance himselfe exceedinglie.
    Lo (quoth his maister) now I have wonne: but in troth the Maior hath
    borrowed mine asse, for the use of the old ilfavoured witch his wife:
    and thereupon immediatlie he hoong downe his eares, and halted downe
    right, as though he had beene starke lame. Then said his maister; I
    perceive you love yoong prettie wenches: at which words he looked up,
    as it were with joifull cheere. And then his maister did bid him go
    choose one that should ride upon him; and he ran to a verie handsome
    woman, and touched hir with his head: &amp;c. A snake will never be brought
    to such familiaritie, &amp;c. <i>Bodin</i><span class="sni"><i>J. Bod. lib.
    de dæm. 2. cap. 6.</i></span> saith, that this was a man in the
    likenesse of an asse: but I maie/<span class="snp" id="p_254"><i>254.</i></span> rather thinke that he is an asse in
    the likenesse of a man. Well, to returne to our serpents, I will tell
    you a storie concerning the charming of them, and the event of the same.</p>

  <p>In the citie of <i>Salisborogh</i><span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef. part
    2. qu. 3. cap 9.<br />John. Bodin.</i></span> there was an inchanter, that before
    all the people tooke upon him to conjure all the serpents and snakes
    within one mile compasse into a great pit or dike, and there to kill
    them. When all the serpents were gathered togither, as he stood
    upon the brinke of the pit, there came at the last a great and a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
    horrible serpent, which would not be gotten downe with all the force
    of his incantations: so as (all the rest being dead) he flew upon the
    inchanter, and clasped him in the middest, and drew him downe into
    the said dike, and there killed him. You must thinke that this was a
    divell in a serpents likenesse, which for the love he bare to the poore
    snakes, killed the sorcerer; to teach all other witches to beware of
    the like wicked practise. And surelie, if this be not true, there be a
    great number of lies conteined in <i>M. Mal.</i> and in <i>J. Bodin</i>. And if
    this be well weighed, and conceived, it beateth downe to the ground all
    those witchmongers arguments, that contend to wring witching miracles
    out of this place. For they disagree notablie, some denieng and some
    affirming that serpents maie be bewitched. Neverthelesse, bicause in
    everie point you shall see how poperie agreeth with paganisme, I will
    recite certeine charmes against vipers, allowed for the most part in
    and by the church of <i>Rome</i>: as followeth.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Exorcismes or conjuratiōs against serpents.</span>
    I conjure thee O serpent in this houre, by the five holie woonds of
    our/<span class="snp"><b>184.</b></span> Lord, that thou remove not out of this place, but here staie, as
    certeinelie as God was borne of a pure virgine. ❈ Otherwise: I
    conjure thee serpent <i>In nomine patris, &amp; filii, &amp; spiritus sancti</i>:
    I command thee serpent by our ladie S. <i>Marie</i>, that thou obeie me,
    as wax obeieth the fier, and as fier obeieth water; that thou neither
    hurt me, nor anie other christian, as certeinelie as God was borne of
    an immaculate virgine, in which respect I take thee up, <i>In nomine
    patris &amp; filii, &amp; spiritus sancti: Ely lash eiter, ely lash eiter, ely
    lash eiter</i>. ❈ Otherwise: O vermine, thou must come as God came
    unto the Jewes.<span class="sni"><i>L. Vair. lib. de fascinat. 1. cap. 4.</i></span>
    ❈ Otherwise: <i>L. Vairus</i> saith, that <i>Serpens
    quernis frondibus contacta</i>, that a serpent touched with oke leaves
    dieth, and staieth even in the beginning of his going, if a feather of
    the bird <i>Ibis</i> be cast or throwne upon him: and that/<span class="snp" id="p_255"><i>255.</i></span> a viper smitten
    or hot with a reed is astonied, and touched with a beechen branch is
    presentlie numme and stiffe.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Usurpers of kinred with blessed Paule and S Katharine.</span>
    Here is to be remembred, that manie use to boast that they are of S.
    <i>Paules</i> race and kinred, shewing upon their bodies the prints of
    serpents: which (as the papists affirme) was incident to all them of S.
    <i>Paules</i> stocke. Marie they saie herewithall, that all his kinsfolks
    can handle serpents, or anie poison without danger. Others likewise
    have (as they brag) a <i>Katharine</i> wheele upon their bodies, and they
    saie they are kin to S. <i>Katharine</i>, and that they can carrie burning
    coles in their bare hands, and dip their said hands in hot skalding
    liquor, and also go into hot ovens. Whereof though the last be but a
    bare jest, and to be doone by anie that will prove (as a bad fellow
    in <i>London</i> had used to doo, making no tariance at all therein:)
    yet there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
    is a shew made of the other, as though it were certeine
    and undoubted; by annointing the hands with the juice of mallowes,
    mercurie, urine, &amp;c: which for a little time are defensatives against
    these scalding liquors, and scortching fiers.</p>

  <p>But they that take upon them to worke these mysteries and miracles, doo
    indeed (after rehearsall of these and such like words and charmes) take
    up even in their bare hands, those snakes and vipers, and sometimes
    put them about their necks, without receiving anie hurt thereby, to
    the terror and astonishment of the beholders, which naturallie both
    feare and abhorre all serpents. But these charmers (upon my word) dare
    not trust to their charmes, but use such an inchantment, as everie man
    maie lawfullie use, and in the lawfull use thereof maie bring to passe
    that they shalbe in securitie, and take no harme, how much soever they
    handle them: marie with a woollen rag they pull out their teeth before
    hand, as some men saie; but as truth is, they wearie them, and that
    is of certeintie. And surelie this is a kind of witchcraft, which I
    terme private confederacie. <i>Bodin</i><span class="sni"><i>J. Bodin.
    lib. de dæm. 1. cap. 3.</i></span> saith, that all the snakes in one
    countrie were by charmes and verses driven into another region: perhaps
    he meaneth <i>Ireland</i>, where S. <i>Patrike</i> is said to have doone it with
    his holinesse, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>James Sprenger</i>, and <i>Henrie Institor</i> affirme, that serpents and
    snakes, and their skins exceed all other creatures for witchcraft:
    in so much as witches doo use to burie them under mens/<span class="snp" id="p_256"><i>256.</i></span> threshholds,
    either of the house or stalles, whereby barrennes is procured both
    to woman and beast: yea and that the verie earth and ashes of them
    continue to have force of fascination. In respect whereof they wish all
    men now and then to dig/<span class="snp"><b>185.</b></span> awaie the earth under their threshholds, and
    to sprinkle holie water in the place, &amp; also to hang boughes (hallowed
    on midsummer daie) at the stall doore where the
    cattell stand: &amp; produce examples thereupon,
    of witches lies, or else their owne, which
    I omit; bicause I see my booke

    a great cake, and so beguiled hir sisters, &amp;c. And this tale I heard
    among my grandams maides, whereby I can decipher this witchcraft.
    Item, by the tingling of the eare, men heretofore could tell what was
    spoken of them. If anie see a scorpion, and saie this word (<i>Bud</i>)
    <span class="sni">Of the word (<i>Bud</i>) and the Greeke letters Π &amp; Α.</span>

  <h4>¶ <i>A charme teaching how to hurt whom you list with images of wax, &amp;c.</i></h4>

  <p class="drop-cap">MAke an image in his name, whom you would hurt or kill, of new virgine
    wax; under the right arme poke whereof place a swallowes hart, and the
    liver under the left; then hang about the necke thereof a new thred in
    a new needle pricked into the member which you would have hurt, with
    the rehearsall of certeine words, which for the avoiding of foolish
    superstition and credulitie in this behalfe is to be omitted. And if
    they were inserted, I dare undertake they would doo no harme, were it
    not to make fooles, and catch gudgins. ❈ Otherwise: Sometimes
    these images are made of brasse, and then the hand is placed where the
    foote should be, and the foote where the hand, and the face downeward.
    ❈ Otherwise: For a greater mischeefe,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span> the like image is made in
    the forme of a man or woman, upon whose head is written the certeine
    name of the partie: and on his or hir ribs these words, <i>Ailif,
    casyl, zaze, hit/ mel meltat</i>:<span class="snp"><b>186.</b></span> then
    the same must be buried.<span class="sni">The practiser of these charmes must have skill in the
    planetarie motions, or else he may go shoo the goose.</span> ❈
    Otherwise: In the dominion of <i>Mars</i>, two images must be prepared, one
    of wax, the other of the earth of a dead man; each image must have in
    his hand a sword wherwith a man hath beene slaine, &amp; he that must be
    slaine may have his head thrust through with a foine. In both must be
    written certeine peculiar characters, and then must they be hid in a
    certeine place. ❈ Otherwise: To obteine a womans love, an image
    must be made in the houre of <i>Venus</i>, of virgine wax, in the name of
    the beloved, wherupon a character is written, &amp; is warmed at a fier,
    and in dooing therof the name of some angell must be mentioned. To be
    utterlie rid of the witch, and to hang hir up by the haire, you must
    prepare an image of the earth of a dead man to be baptised in another
    mans name, whereon the name, with a character, must be written: then
    must it be perfumed with a rotten bone, and then these psalmes read
    backward: <i>Domine Dominus noster</i>, <i>Dominus illuminatio mea</i>, <i>Domine
      exaudi orationem meam</i>, <i>Deus laudem meam ne tacueris</i>: and then burie
    it, first in one place, and/<span class="snp" id="p_258"><i>258.</i></span> afterwards in another. Howbeit, it is
    written in the 21 article of the determination of <i>Paris</i>, that to
    affirme that images of brasse, lead, gold, of white or red wax, or of
    any other stuffe (conjured, baptised, consecrated, or rather execrated
    through these magicall arts at certeine days) have woonderfull vertues,
    or such as are avowed in their bookes or assertions, is error in faith,
    naturall philosophie, and true astronomie: yea it is concluded in the
    22 article of that councell, that it is as great an error to beleeve
    those things, as to doo them.</p>

  <p>But concerning these images, it is certeine that they are much feared
    among the people, and much used among cousening witches, as partlie
    appeereth in this discourse of mine else-where, &amp; as partlie you may
    see by the contents of this storie<span class="sni">A proved storie concerning the premisses.</span> following. Not long sithence,
    a yoong maiden (dwelling at new <i>Romnie</i> heere in Kent) being the
    daughter of one M. <i>L. Stuppenie</i> (late Jurat of the same towne but
    dead before the execution hereof) and afterwards the wife of <i>Thomas
      Eps</i>, who is at this instant Maior of <i>Romnie</i>) was visited with
    sicknesse, whose mother and father in lawe being abused with credulitie
    concerning witches supernaturall power, repaired to a famous witch
    called mother <i>Baker</i>, dwelling not far from thence at a place called
    <i>Stonstreet</i>, who (according to witches cousening custome) asked
    whether they mistrusted not some bad neighbour, to whom they answered
    that indeed they doubted a woman neere unto them (and yet the same
    woman was, of the honester &amp; wiser sort of hir
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span> neighbors, reputed a
    good creature.) Nevertheles the witch told them that there was great
    cause of their suspicion: for the same (said she) is the verie partie
    that wrought the maidens destruction, by making a hart of wax, and
    pricking the same with pins and needels; affirming also that the same
    neighbor of hirs had bestowed the same in some secret corner of the
    house. This being beleeved, the house was searched by credible persons,
    but nothing could be found. The witch or wise woman being certified
    hereof, continued hir assertion, and would needs go to the house where
    she hir selfe (as she affirmed) would certeinlie find it. When she came
    thither, she used hir cunning (as it chanced) to hir owne confusion,
    or at least/wise<span class="snp"><b>187.</b></span> to hir detection: for heerein she did, as some of the
    wiser sort mistrusted that she woulde doo, laieng downe privilie such
    an/<span class="snp" id="p_259"><i>259.</i></span> image (as she had before described) in a corner, which by others
    had beene most diligentlie searched &amp; looked into, &amp; by that means hir
    cousenage was notablie bewraied. And I would wish that all witchmongers
    might paie for their lewd repaire to inchantors, and consultation with
    witches, and such as have familiar spirits, as some of these did, and
    that by the order of the high commissioners, which partlie for respect
    of neighborhood, and partlie for other considerations, I leave unspoken
    of.</p>

  <p>This terrible cursse with bell, booke, and candell added thereunto,
    must needs worke woonders: howbeit among theeves it is not much
    weighed, among wise and true men it is not well liked, to them that
    are robbed it bringeth small releefe: the preests stomach may well be
    eased, but the goods stolne will never the sooner be restored. Hereby
    is bewraied both the malice and follie of popish doctrine, whose
    uncharitable impietie is so impudentlie published, and in such order
    uttered, as everie sentence (if oportunitie served) might be prooved
    both hereticall and diabolicall. But I will answer this cruell cursse

    cursse the theefe, and all his confederates, with bell, booke, and
    candell, that they should have small joy of their fish. And therefore
    the next sundaie, sir <i>John</i> got him to the pulpit, with his surplisse
    on his backe, and his stole about his necke, and pronounced these words
    following in the audience of the people.</p>

    (which is either a roote, or rather in this place garlike)
    in the roofe of the house, for to keepe awaie witches and spirits: and
    so they doo Alicium also. ❈ Otherwise: Item perfume made of the
    gall of a blake dog, and his bloud besmeered on the posts and walles of
    the house, driveth out of the doores both devils and witches. ❈
    Otherwise: The house/<span class="snp" id="p_267"><i>267.</i></span> where <i>Herba betonica</i> is sowne, is free from
    all mischeefes. ❈ Otherwise: It is not unknowne that the Romish
    church allowed and used the smoke of sulphur, to drive spirits out of
    their houses; as they did frankincense and water hallowed. ❈
    Otherwise: <i>Apuleius</i> saith, that <i>Mercurie</i> gave to <i>Ulysses</i>, when he
    came neere to the inchantresse <i>Circe</i>, an hearbe called <i>Verbascum</i>,
    which in English is called Pullein, or <i>Tapsus barbatus</i>, or Longwoort;
    and that preserved him from the inchantments. ❈ Otherwise: Item
    <i>Plinie</i> and <i>Homer</i> both doo saie, that the herbe called Molie is an
    excellent herbe against inchantments; and saie[,] all that thereby
    <i>Ulysses</i> escaped <i>Circes</i> hir sorceries, and inchantments. ❈

  <p>Furthermore, was it not in times of tempests the papists use, *or<span class="sni">[* ? of <i>or</i> in.]</span>
    superstition, to ring their belles against divels; trusting rather to
    the tonging of their belles, than to their owne crie unto God with
    fasting and praier, assigned by him in all adversities and dangers:
    according to the order of the <i>Thracian</i> preests, which would rore and
    crie, with all the noise they could make, in those tempests. <i>Olaus
    Gothus</i><span class="sni"><i>Olaus Goth. lib. de gentib. Septentriona-lib. 3. cap. 8.</i></span> saith, that his countriemen would shoot in the aire, to assist
    their gods, whome they thought to be then togither by the eares with
    others, and had consecrated arrowes, called <i>Sagittæ Joviales</i>, even
    as our papists had. Also in steed of belles, they had great hammers,
    called <i>Mallei Joviales</i>, to make a noise in time of thunder. In some
    countries they runne out of the doores in time of tempest, blessing
    themselves with a cheese, whereupon there was a crosse made with a
    ropes end upon ascension daie. Also three hailestones to be throwne
    into the fier in a tempest, and thereupon to be said three <i>Pater
    nosters</i>, and three <i>Aves</i>, S. <i>Johns</i> gospell, and <i>in fine fugiat
    tempestas</i>, is a present remedie. Item, to hang an eg laid on ascension

    *Item,<span class="sni">* A witches conjuration to make haile cease and be dissolved.</span>
    I conjure you haile and wind by the five wounds of Christ,

    useth excommunication as a principall charme. And now to be delivered

    pentaphyllon, cinquefole, also an olive branch, also frankincense,
    myrrh, valerian, verven, palme, antirchmon, &amp;c: also haythorne,
    otherwise white[t]horne gathered on Maie daie: also the smoke of
    a lappoints fethers driveth spirits/<span class="snp" id="p_269"><i>269.</i></span> awaie. There be innumerable

  <h4>¶ <i>Cures commensed and finished by witchcraft.</i></h4>

  <p class="drop-cap">THere was a jollie fellowe that tooke upon him to be a notable surgion,
    in the dutchie of <i>Mentz</i>, 1567. to whom there resorted a Gentleman
    that had beene vexed with sicknesse, named/<span class="snp" id="p_274"><i>274.</i></span> <i>Elibert</i>, having a
    kerchiefe on his head, according to the guise of sicke folke. But the
    surgion made him pull off his kerchiefe, and willed him to drinke with
    him freelie. The sickeman said he durst not; for he was forbidden
    by physicke so to doo. Tush (said this cunning man) they know not
    your disease: be ruled by me, and take in your drinke lustilie. For
    he thought that when he was well tippled, he might the more easilie
    beguile him in his bargaine, and make his reward the greater, which
    he was to receive in part aforehand. When they had well droonke, he
    called the sicke man aside, and told him the greatnes and danger of
    his disease, and how that it grew by meanes of witchcraft, and that it
    would be universallie spread in his house, and among all his cattell,
    if it were not prevented: and impudentlie persuaded the sicke man to
    receive cure of him.<span class="sni">The surgion here most impudentlie setteth his knaverie
    abroch.</span> And after bargaine made, he demanded of the sicke
    man, whether he had not anie at home, whom he might assuredlie trust.
    The sicke man answered, that he had a daughter and a servant. The
    cousener asked how old his daughter was? The patient said, twentie.
    Well (said the cousener) that is fit for our turne. Then he made the
    mother and father to kneele on their knees to their daughter, and to
    desire hir in all things to obey the physician, and that she would
    doo in everie thing as he commanded hir; otherwise hir father could
    not be restored to his health. In which respect hir parents humblie
    besought hir on their knees so to doo. Then he assigned hir to bring
    him into his lodging hir fathers haire, and hir mothers, and of all
    those which he kept in his house, as well of men and women, as also
    of his cattell. When she came therewith unto him, according to the
    match made, and hir parents commandement, he lead hir downe into a
    lowe parlor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
    where having made a long speech, he opened a booke
    that laie on the boord, and laieth thereon two knives acrosse, with
    much circumstance of words.<span class="sni">A pretended conjuration.</span> Then conjureth he, and maketh strange
    characters, and at length he maketh a circle on the ground, wherein he
    causeth hir to sticke one of those conjured knives; and after manie
    more strange words, he maketh hir sticke the other knife beside it.
    Then fell downe the maid in a swoone for feare; so as he was faine to
    frote hir and put a sop into hir mouth, after the receipt whereof she
    was sore troubled and amazed. Then he made hir brests to be uncovered,
    so as when/<span class="snp" id="p_275"><i>275.</i></span> they were bare, he
    dal/lied<span class="snp"><b>198.</b></span> with them, diverslie and long
    together. Then he made hir lie right upward, all uncovered and bare
    belowe hir pappes. Wherein the maid being loth to obeie him, resisted,
    and in shame forbad that villanie. Then said the knave; Your fathers
    destruction is at hand: for except you will be ruled, he and all his
    familie shall susteine greater greefe and inconvenience, than is yet
    happened unto him. And no remedie, except you will seeke his utter
    overthrowe, I must have carnall copulation with you, and therewithall
    fell into hir bosome, and overthrew hir and hir virginitie. So did
    he the second daie, and attempted the like on the third daie.<span class="sni"><i>Ad
    vada tot vadit urna quòd ipsa cadit.</i></span> But he
    failed then of his purpose, as the wench confessed afterwards. In the
    meane time he ministred so cruell medicines to the sicke man, that
    through the torments therof he feared present death, and was faine to
    keepe his bed, whereas he walked about before verie well and lustilie.
    The patient in his torments calleth unto him for remedie, who being
    slacke and negligent in that behalfe, made roome for the daughter to
    accompanie hir father, who asked hir what she thought of the cure, and
    what hope she had of his recoverie. Who with teares remained silent, as
    being oppressed with greefe; till at the last in abundance of sorrowe
    she uttered the whole matter to hir father. This dooth <i>Johannes
      Wierus</i> report, saieng, that it came unto him by the lamentable
    relation of the father himselfe. And this is here at this time for none
    other purpose rehearsed, but that men may hereby learne to take heed of
    such cousening merchants, and knowe what they be that take upon them
    to be so cunning in witchcraft; least they be bewitched: as maister

    fascination. And that is, first they saie the force of celestiall
    bodies, which indifferentlie communicate their vertues unto men,
    beasts, trees, stones, &amp;c. But this gift and naturall influence of
    fascination maie be increased in man, according to his affections and
    perturbations; as thorough anger, feare, love, hate, &amp;c. For by hate
    (saith <i>Vairus</i>)<span class="sni"><i>L. Vair. lib. de fascin. 1. c. 12.</i></span> entereth a fierie inflammation into the eie of man,
    which being violentlie sent out by beams and streames, &amp;c: infect and
    bewitch those bodies against whome they are opposed. And therefore he
    saith (in the favour of women) that that is the cause why women are
    oftener found to be witches than men. For (saith he) they have such
    an unbrideled force of furie and concupiscence naturallie, that by
    no meanes it is possible for them to temper or moderate the same. So
    <span class="sni">Much like the eiebiting witches, of whom we have elswhere
    spoken.</span> as upon everie trifling occasion, they (like brute beasts) fix their
    furious eies upon the partie whom they bewitch. Hereby it commeth to
    passe, that whereas women having a mervellous fickle nature, what
    greefe so ever happeneth unto them, immediatlie all peaceablenes of
    mind departeth; and they are so troubled with evill humors, that out go
    their venomous exhalations, ingendred thorough their ilfavoured diet,
    and increased by meanes of their pernicious excrements, which they
    expell. Women are also (saith he) monethlie filled full of superfluous
    humors, and with them/<span class="snp" id="p_279"><i>279.</i></span> the melancholike bloud boileth; whereof spring
    vapors, and are carried up, and conveied through the nosethrels and
    mouth, &amp;c: to the bewitching of whatsoever it meeteth. For they belch
    up a certeine breath, wherewith they bewitch whomsoever they list.
    And of all other women,<span class="sni">Who are most likelie to bewitch, and to be bewitched.</span> leane, hollow eied, old, beetlebrowed women
    (saith he) are the most infectious. Marie he saith, that hot, subtill,
    and thin bodies are most subject to be bewitched, if they be moist,
    and all they generallie, whose veines, pipes, and passages of their
    bodies are open. And finallie he saith, that all beautifull things
    whatsoever, are soone subject to be bewitched; as namelie goodlie
    yoongmen, faire women, such as are naturallie borne to be rich, goodlie
    beasts, faire horsses, ranke corne, beutifull trees, &amp;c. Yea a freend
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
    of his told him, that he saw one with his eie breake a pretious stone
    in peeces. And all this he telleth as soberlie, as though it were true.
    And if it were true, honest women maie be witches, in despight of all
    inquisitors: neither can anie avoid being a witch, except shee locke
    hir selfe up in a chamber.</p>

    the charme be understandable or not, it skilleth not: so the charmer

    it that cannot be done by words? For <i>L. Vairus</i><span class="sni"><i>L.

    have infeebled and killed children with words, and have made women

    According to <i>Ovids</i> saieng of <i>Proteus</i> &amp; <i>Medea</i>,
    which he indeed alledgeth therefore, <i>Nunc aqua, nunc ales, modò bos,

    men into beasts, flowne in the aire, tamed and staied wild beasts,
    driven all noisome cattell and vermine from corne, vines and hearbs,

    gone upon a sharpe sword, and walked upon hot glowing coles, without
    hurt; with words (saith he) verie heavie weights and burthens have
    beene lifted up; and with words wild horsses and wild bulles have
    beene tamed, and also mad dogs; with words they have killed wormes,
    and other vermine, and staied all maner of bleedings and fluxes: with
    words all the diseases in mans bodie are healed, and wounds cured;
    arowes are with wonderfull strangenesse and cunning plucked out of
    mens bones. Yea (saith he) there be manie that can heale all bitings
    of dogs, or stingings of serpents, or anie other poison: and all with
    nothing but words spoken. And that which is most strange, he saith,
    that they can remedie anie stranger, and him that is absent, with that

    paine. With a number of other cures, done altogither by the vertue and
    force of words uttered and spoken.</p>

  <p>Where, by the waie, I maie not omit this speciall note, given by <i>M.
    Mal.</i><span class="sni"><i>Mal. Malef. par. 2. quæ. 2. cap. 7.</i></span>
    to wit, that holie water maie not be sprinkled upon bewitched
    beasts, but must be powred into their mouthes. And yet he, and also
    <i>Nider</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Nider in præceptorio, præcept. 1. ca.
    11.</i></span> saie, that It is lawfull to blesse and sanctifie beasts,
    as well as men; both by charmes written, and also by holie words
    spoken. For (saith <i>Nider</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Nider in fornicario.</i></span>
    if your cow be bewitched, three crosses,
    three <i>Pater nosters</i>, and three <i>Aves</i> will certeinlie cure hir: and
    likewise<span class="sni"><i>Mal. Malef. part. 2. cap. 8.</i></span>
    all other ceremonies ecclesiasticall. And this is a sure
    <i>Maxime</i>,*<span class="sni">[* <i>Ital.</i>]</span> that they which are delivered from witchcraft by shrift,
    are ever after in the night much molested (I beleeve by their ghostlie
    fathers.) Also they loose their monie out of their pursses and caskets:
    as <i>M. Mal.</i> saith he knoweth by experience./<span class="snp" id="p_281"><i>281.</i></span> Also one generall rule is
    given by <i>M. Mal.</i><span class="sni">A good devise to starve up poore
    women.</span> to all butter wives, and dairie maides, that they
    neither give nor lend anie butter, milke, or cheese, to anie witches,
    which alwaies use to beg therof, when they meane to worke mischeefe
    <span class="sni"><i>Mal. Malef. part. 2. quæ. 2, cap. 7.</i></span>
    to their kine or whitmeats. Whereas indeed there are in milke three
    substances commixted; to wit, butter, cheese, and whaie: if the same
    be kept too long, or in an evill place, or be sluttishlie used, so as
    it be stale and sower, which happeneth sometimes in winter, but
    oftener in summer, when it is set over the fier, the cheese and butter
    runneth togither, and congealeth, so as it will rope like birdlime,
    that you maie wind it about a sticke, and/<span class="sni"><b>198.<sup>[2]</sup></b></span> in short space it will be so
    drie, as you maie beate it to powder. Which alteration being strange,
    is woondered at, and imputed to witches. And herehence sometimes
    proceedeth the cause, why butter commeth not, which when the countrie
    people see that it commeth not, then get they out of the suspected
    witches house, a little butter, whereof must be made three balles, in
    the name of the holie trinitie; and so if they be put into the cherne,
    the butter will presentlie come, and the witchcraft will cease; <i>Sic
    ars deluditur arte</i>. But if you put a little sugar or sope into the
    cherne, among the creame, the butter will never come: which is plaine
    witchcraft, if it be closelie, cleanlie, and privilie handled. There be
    twentie severall waies to make your butter come, which for brevitie I
    omit; as to bind your cherne with a rope, to thrust thereinto a red hot
    spit, &amp;c: but your best remedie and surest waie is, to looke well to
    your dairie maid or wife, that she neither eat up the creame, nor sell
    awaie your butter.</p>

    ceaseth hir torments. And we have knowne saith <i>M. Mal.</i> when the witch
    could not come in, that the whole house hath beene so darkened, and the
    aire round about the same so troubled, with such horrible noise and
    earthquakes; that except the doore had beene opened, we had thought the
    house would have fallen on our heads. <i>Thomas Aquinas</i>, a principall

  <p>Lo this is their stuffe, mainteined to be at the least effectuall, if
    not wholsome, by all papists and witchmongers, and speciallie of the
    last and proudest writers. But to proove these things to be effectuall,
    God knoweth their reasons are base and absurd. For they write so, as
    they take the matter in question as granted,/<span class="snp" id="p_283"><i>283.</i></span> and by that meanes go
    awaie therewith. For <i>L. Vairus</i><span class="sni"><i>L. Vair. lib.

    that there is no doubt of this supernaturall matter, bicause a number
    of writers agree herein, and a number of stories confirme it, and manie
    poets handle the same argument, and in the twelve tables there is a
    lawe against it, and bicause the consent of the common people is fullie
    with it, and bicause immoderate praise is to be approoved a kind of
    witchcraft, and bicause old women have such charmes and superstitious
    meanes as preserve themselves from it, and bicause they are mocked that
    take awaie the credit of such miracles, and bicause <i>Salomon</i><span class="sni">Sapi.

    seeme to distrust and detract anie thing from the credit of so manie
    grave men, from histories, and common opinion of all men: he meaneth in
    no wise to proove that there is miraculous working by witchcraft and

    be conceived, in that the inchanters of <i>Pharao</i>, being magicians of
    <i>Aegypt</i>, were called <i>Hartumim</i>. And yet in <i>Exodus</i> they are named in
    some Latine translations <i>Venefici</i>. <i>Rabbi Levi</i> saith, it betokeneth
    such as doo strange and woonderfull things, naturallie, artificiallie,
    and deceitfullie. <i>Rabbi Isaac Natar</i> affirmeth, that such were so
    termed, as amongst the Gentiles professed singular wisedome. <i>Aben
    Ezra</i> expoundeth it, to signifie such as knowe the secrets of nature,
    and the qualitie of stones and hearbs, &amp;c: which is atteined unto by
    art, and/<span class="snp"><b>203.</b></span> speciallie by naturall magicke. But we, either for want of
    speach, or knowlege, call them all by the name/<span class="snp" id="p_288"><i>288.</i></span> and terme of witches.</p>

  <p>Certeinlie, God indueth bodies with woonderfull graces, the perfect
    knowledge whereof man hath not reached unto: and on the one side,
    there is amongst them such mutuall love, societie, and consent; and
    on the other side, such naturall discord, and secret enimitie, that
    therein manie things are wrought to the astonishment of mans capacitie.
    But when deceit and diabolicall words are coupled therewith, then
    extendeth it to witchcraft and conjuration; as whereunto those naturall
    effects are falselie imputed.<span class="sni">The authors intention touching the matter hereafter to be
    discoursed upon.</span> So as heere I shall have some occasion
    to say somewhat of naturall magicke; bicause under it lieth hidden
    the venome of this word <i>Hartumim</i>. This art is said by some to be
    the profoundnesse, and the verie absolute perfection of naturall
    philosophie, and shewing foorth the active part thereof, &amp; through the
    aid of naturall vertues, by the convenient applieng of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span> them, works
    are published, exceeding all capacitie and admiration; and yet not
    so much by art, as by nature. This art of it selfe is not evill; for
    it consisteth in searching foorth the nature, causes, and effects of
    things. As farre as I can conceive, it hath beene more corrupted and
    prophaned by us Christians, than either by Jewes or Gentiles.</p>

  <p class="subhead"><i>How the philosophers in times past travelled for the knowledge
    of naturall magicke, of Salomons knowledge therein, who is to
    be called a naturall magician, a distinction thereof, and why
    it is condemned for witchcraft.</i></p>

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_m1.png" width="75" height="75" alt='M' /></span>ANIE
    philosophers; as namely <i>Plato</i>, <i>Pythagoras</i>, <i>Empedocles</i>,
    <i>Democritus</i>, &amp;c: travelled over all the world, to find out &amp; learne
    the knowlege of this art; &amp; at their returne they preached and taught,
    professed and published it. Yea, it should appeere by the magicians
    that came to adore Christ, that the knowledge and re/putation<span class="snp" id="p_289"><i>289.</i></span> thereof
    was greater, than we conceive or make account of. But of all other,
    <i>Salomon</i> was the greatest traveller in this art, as may appeere
    throughout the booke of <i>Ecclesiastes</i>: and speciallie in the booke of
    <i>Wisedome</i>, where hee saith*<span class="sni">* Sap. 7, 17<br /> 18.<br /> 19.<br /> 20.<br /> 21.</span>
    God hath given me the true science
    of things, so as I knowe how the world was made, and the power of the
    elements, the beginning and the end, and the middest of times, how the
    times alter, and the change of seasons, the course of the yeare, and
    the situation of the starres, the nature of living things, and the
    furiousnesse of beasts, the power of the wind, and the imaginations
    of men, the diversities of plants, and the vertues of roots, and all
    things both secret and knowne, &amp;c. Finallie, he was so cunning in
    this art, that he is said to have bene a conjurer or witch,<span class="sni"><i>See Iidioni.</i><br />[<i>Iidoni.</i>]</span> and is
    so reputed in the Romish church at this daie. Whereby you may see,
    how fooles and papists are inclined to credit false accusations in
    matters of/<span class="snp"><b>204.</b></span> witchcraft and conjuration. The lesse knowledge we have in
    this art, the more we have it in contempt: in which respect <i>Plato</i>
    saith trulie to <i>Dionysius</i>; They make philosophie a mockerie, that
    deliver it to prophane and rude people. Certeinlie, the witchcraft,
    conjuration, and inchantment that is imputed to <i>Salomon</i>,<span class="sni">Eccle. 1. &amp; 1.</span> is gathered
    out of these his words following: I applied my mind to knowledge,
    and to search and seeke out science, wisedome and understanding, to
    knowe the foolishnesse of the ungodlie, and the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span> error of doting
    fooles. In this art of naturall magike (without great heed be taken) a
    student shall soone be abused. For manie (writing by report, without
    experience) mistake their authors, and set downe one thing for another.
    Then the conclusions being found false, the experiment groweth into
    contempt, and in the end seemeth ridiculous, though never so true.
    <i>Plinie</i> and <i>Albert</i> being curious writers heerein, are often
    deceived; insomuch as <i>Plinie</i> is called a noble lier, and <i>Albert</i> a
    rusticall lier; the one lieng by heeresaie, the other by authoritie.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">A magician described and the art distinguished.</span>A magician is indeed that which the Latines call a wise man, as
    <i>Numa Pompilius</i> was among the Romans; The Greeks, a philosopher, as
    <i>Socrates</i> was among them; the <i>Aegyptians</i> a preest, as <i>Hermes</i> was;
    the Cabalists called them prophets. But although these distinguished
    this art, accounting the one part/<span class="snp" id="p_290"><i>290.</i></span> thereof infamous, as being too much
    given unto wicked, vaine, and impious curiositie, as unto moovings,
    numbers, figures, sounds, voices, tunes, lights, affections of the
    mind, and words; and the other part commendable, as teaching manie
    good and necessarie things, as times and seasons to sowe, plant, till,
    cut, &amp;c: and diverse other things, which I will make manifest unto
    you heereafter: yet we generallie condemne the whole art, without
    distinction, as a part of witchcraft; having learned to hate it, before
    we knowe it; affirming all to be witchcraft, which our grosse heads are
    not able to conceive, and yet can thinke that an old doting woman seeth
    through it, &amp;c. Wherein we consider not how God bestoweth his gifts,
    and hath established an order in his works, graffing in them sundrie
    vertues to the comfort of his severall creatures; and speciallie to
    the use and behoofe of man: neither doo we therein weigh that art is
    servant unto nature, and waiteth upon hir as hir handmaiden.</p>

    estimation of witchcraft. But being learned and knowne, they are
    contemned, and appeere ridiculous: for that onelie is woonderfull to
    the beholder, whereof he can conceive no cause nor reason, according
    to the saieng of <i>Ephesius</i>, <i>Miraculum solvitur unde videtur esse
      miraculum</i>. And therefore a man shall take great paines heerein, and
    bestow great cost to learne that which is of no value, and a meere
    jugling knacke. Whereupon it is said, that a man may not learne
    philosophie to be rich; but must get riches to learne philosophie:

    never opened.<span class="sni">Naturall magicke hath a double end, which proveth y<sup>e</sup>

    other feathers, if they be intermedled together. Wherein it may not be
    denied, but nature sheweth hir selfe a proper workwoman. But it seemeth
    unpossible, that a little fish being but halfe a foot long, called

    waters heere in <i>England</i> transubstantiated into a stone? The which
    vertue is also found to be in a lake besides the citie <i>Masaca</i> in

    excellent vertues and qualities of stones, found, conceived and
    tried by this art, is woonderfull. Howbeit many things most false and
    fabulous are added unto their true effects, wherewith I thought good in
    part to trie the readers patience and cunning withall. An Aggat (they
    saie) hath vertue against the biting of scorpions or serpents. It is
    written (but I will not stand to it) that it maketh a man eloquent, and
    procureth the favour of princes; yea that the fume thereof dooth turne
    awaie tempests. Alectorius is a stone about the bignesse of a beane,
    as cleere as/<span class="snp"><b>207.</b></span> the christall, taken out of a cocks bellie which hath
    beene gelt or made a capon foure yeares.<span class="sni"><i>Ludovicus Cœlius. Rhodo. lib. antiq. lect. 11. ca. 70.<br />

    it asswageth thirst, it maketh the husband to love the wife, and the
    bearer invincible: for heereby <i>Milo</i> was said to overcome his enimies.
    A crawpocke delivereth from prison. Chelidonius is a stone taken out of
    a swallowe, which cureth melancholie: howbeit, some authors saie, it is
    the hearbe wherby the swallowes recover the sight of their yoong, even
    if their eies be picked out with an instrument. Geranites is taken out
    of a crane, and Draconites out of a dragon. But it is to be noted, that
    such stones must be taken out of the bellies of the serpents, beasts,
    or birds,/<span class="snp" id="p_294"><i>294.</i></span> (wherein they are) whiles they live: otherwise, they vanish
    awaie with the life, and so they reteine the vertues of those starres
    under which they are. Amethysus maketh a droonken man sober, and
    refresheth the wit. The*<span class="sni"> <i>* Avicenna cano. 2. tract. 2. cap. 124.<br />

    fascination or bewitching, and in this respect they are hanged about
    childrens necks. But from whence that superstition is derived, and who
    invented the lie, I knowe not: but I see how readie the people are to
    give credit thereunto, by the multitude of corrals that waie emploied.
    I find in good authors, that while it remaineth in the sea, it is an
    hearbe; and when it is brought thence, into the aire, it hardeneth, and
    becommeth a stone.</p>

  <p>Heliotropius stancheth bloud, driveth awaie poisons, preserveth health:
    yea, and some write that it provoketh raine, and darkeneth the sunne,
    suffering not him that beareth it to be abused. Hyacinthus dooth all
    that the other dooth, and also preserveth from lightening. Dinothera
    hanged about the necke, collar, or yoke of any creature, tameth it
    presentlie. A Topase healeth the lunatike person of his
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>passion of
    lunacie. Aitites, if it be shaken, soundeth as if there were a little
    stone in the bellie thereof: it is good for the falling sicknesse,
    and to prevent untimelie birth. Amethysus aforesaid resisteth
    droonkenesse, so as the bearers shall be able to drinke freelie, and
    recover themselves soone being droonke as apes: the same maketh a man
    wise. Chalcedonius maketh the bearer luckie in lawe, quickeneth the
    power of the bodie, and is of force also against the illusions of the
    divell, and phantasticall cogitations arising of melancholie. Corneolus
    mitigateth the heate of the mind, and qualifieth malice, it stancheth
    bloudie fluxes, speciallie of women that are troubled with their
    flowers.<span class="sni"><i>Plin. lib. 37. cap. 10.<br />Albert. lib.

    stancheth bloud, procureth good fame, keepeth the bearer in health, and

    be deerer than a thousand diamonds.</p>

  <p>Hyacinthus delivereth one from the danger of lightening, driveth
    awaie poison and pestilent infection, and hath manie other vertues.
    Iris helpeth a woman to speedie deliverance, and maketh rainebowes to

    helpeth agues and gowts, and suffereth not the bearer to be afraid:

    Magnus</i>) being broken into powder, and droonke with water, maketh
    insensibilitie of torture. Heereby you may understand, that as God hath
    bestowed upon these stones, and such other like bodies, most excellent
    and woonderfull virtues; so according to the abundance of humane
    superstitions and follies, manie ascribe unto them either more vertues,
    or others than they have: other boast that they are able to adde new
    qualities unto them. And heerin consisteth a part of witchcraft and
    common cousenage used sometimes of the Lapidaries for gaines; sometimes
    of others for cousening purposes. Some part of the vanitie heereof I
    will heere describe, bicause the place serveth well therefore. And it
    is not to be forgotten or omitted, that <i>Pharos</i> magicians were like
    enough to be cunning therein.</p>

  <p>Neverthelesse, I will first give you the opinion of one, who professed
    himselfe a verie skilfull and well experimented Lapidarie, as appeereth
    by a booke of his owne penning, published under this title of

    of such monsters, beasts, and other devises, as they imagine to be
    both internallie in operation, and externallie in view, expressed in
    the planets. As for example, upon the<span class="sni"><i>Plin. lib. 37. cap. 10.<br />Albert. miner. li. 2. ca. 1.<br />

    venomous beasts; and sometimes a man riding on a serpent: which they
    know to be <i>Aesculapius</i>, which is the celestiall serpent, whereby are
    cured (they saie) poisons and stingings of serpents and scorpions.
    These grow in the river of <i>Achates</i>, where the/<span class="snp"><b>210.</b></span> greatest scorpions
    are ingendred, and their noisomnes is thereby qualified, and by the
    force of the scorpions the stones vertue is quickened and increased.
    Also, if they would induce love for the accomplishment of venerie, they
    inscribe and expresse in the stones, amiable embracings and love/lie<span class="snp" id="p_298"><i>298.</i></span>
    countenances and gestures, words and kissings in apt figures. For the
    desires of the mind are consonant with the nature of the stones, which
    must also be set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
    in rings, and upon foiles of such metals as have
    affinitie with those stones, thorough the operation of the planets
    whereunto they are addicted, whereby they may gather the greater force
    of their working.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Geor. Pictorius. Villang. doct. medici in scholiis super
    Marbod. dactyl.</i></span>As for example, They make the images of <i>Saturne</i> in lead, of <i>Sol</i>
    in gold, of <i>Luna</i> in silver. Marrie there is no small regard to be
    had for the certeine and due times to be observed in the graving of
    them: for so are they made with more life, and the influences and
    configurations of the planets are made thereby the more to abound in
    them. As if you will procure love, you must worke in apt, proper, and
    freendlie aspects, as in the houre of <i>Venus</i>, <i>&amp;c</i>: to make debate,
    the direct contrarie order is to be taken. If you determine to make
    the image of <i>Venus</i>, you must expect to be under <i>Aquarius</i> or
    <i>Capricornus</i>: for <i>Saturne</i>, <i>Taurus</i>, and <i>Libra</i> must be taken heed
    of. Manie other observations there be, as to avoid the infortunate
    seate and place of the planets, when you would bring a happie thing to
    passe, and speciallie that it be not doone in the end, declination, or
    heele (as they terme it) of the course thereof: for then the planet
    moorneth and is dull.</p>

  <p>Such signes as ascend in the daie, must be taken in the daie; if in
    the night they increase, then must you go to worke by night, &amp;c.
    For in <i>Aries</i>, <i>Leo</i>, and <i>Sagittarie</i> is a certeine triplicitie,
    wherein the sunne hath dominion by daie, <i>Jupiter</i> by night, and in
    the twielight the cold star of <i>Saturne</i>. But bicause there shall be
    no excuse wanting for the faults espied herein, they saie that the
    vertues of all stones decaie through tract of time: so as such things
    are not now to be looked for in all respects as are written. Howbeit
    <i>Jannes</i> and <i>Jambres</i> were living in that time, and in no inconvenient
    place; and therefore not unlike to have that helpe towards the abusing
    of <i>Pharao</i>. <i>Cardane</i><span class="sni"><i>H. Card. lib. de subtil. 10.</i></span> saith, that although men attribute no small
    force unto such seales; as to the seale of the sunne, authorities,
    honors, and favors of princes; of <i>Jupiter</i>, riches and freends; of
    <i>Venus</i>, pleasures; of <i>Mars</i>, boldnes; of <i>Mercurie</i>, diligence;
    of <i>Saturne</i>, patience and induring of labour; of <i>Luna</i>, favour of
    people: I am not ignorant (saith he) that stones doo good, and yet I
    knowe the seales or figures doo/<span class="snp" id="p_299"><i>299.</i></span> none at all. And when <i>Cardane</i>

    shewed fullie that art, and the follie thereof, and the maner of those
    terrible, prodigious, &amp; deceitfull figures of the planets with their
    characters, &amp;c.: he saith that those were deceitfull inventions devised
    by couseners, and had no vertue indeed nor truth in them. But bicause

    poison. Othersome also are found figured and marked with the forme of
    a man bearing on his necke a bundle of hearbs and flowres, with the
    estimation and value of them noted, that they have in them a facultie
    or power restrictive, and will in an instant or moment of time stanch
    bloud. Such a kind of stone (as it is reported) <i>Galen</i> wore on his

    common and knowne, you would not regard them. And yet <i>Empedocles</i>

    of an ash, &amp;c? But it seemeth not strange, bicause it is common, that
    some man otherwise hardie and stout enough, should not dare to abide

    incredible: how loving the lizzard is to a man, we maie read, though
    we cannot see. Yet some affirme that our newt is not onlie like to
    the lizzard in shape, but also in condition. From the which affection
    towards a man, a spaniell doth not much differ, whereof I could cite
    incredible stories. The amitie betwixt a castrell and a pigeon is much
    noted among writers; and speciallie how the castrell defendeth hir
    from hir enimie the sparowhawke: whereof they saie the doove is not
    ignorant. Besides, the woonderfull operation and vertue of hearbs,
    which to repeat were infinite: and therfore I will onlie referre you to
    <i>Mattheolus</i> his herball, or to <i>Dodonæus</i>. There is among them such
    naturall accord and discord, as some prosper much the better for the
    others companie, and some wither awaie being planted neere unto the
    other. The lillie and the rose rejoise in each others neighborhood. The
    flag and the fernebush abhorre each other so much, that the one can
    hardlie live besides the other. The cowcumber loveth water, and hateth
    oile to the death. And bicause you shall not saie that hearbs have no
    vertue, for that in this place I cite none, I am content to discover
    two or three small qualities and vertues, which are affirmed to be in
    hearbs: marie as simple as they be, <i>Jannes</i> and <i>Jambres</i> might have
    done much with them, if they had had them. If you pricke out a yoong
    swallowes eies, the old swallow restoreth againe their sight, with the
    application (they saie) of a little Celondine. <i>Xan-
    thus</i><span class="sni"><i>Xanthus in hist. prima.</i></span> the author of histories reporteth, that a yoong dragon being

    as strange properties and vertues naturall. I have heard by credible

    deere freend, or of a mortall enimie. Diverse also write, that if one
    passe by a murthered bodie (though unknowne) he shalbe striken with
    feare, and feele in him selfe some alteration by nature. Also that a
    woman, above the age of fiftie yeares, being bound hand and foote,
    hir clothes being upon hir, and laid downe softlie into the water,
    sinketh not in a long time; some saie, not at all.<span class="sni"><i>J. Wierus.</i></span> By which experiment

    had in the left side, the other brother had in the right side. He saith
    further, that manie sawe it, and that it could be referred to nothing,
    but to the proprietie of their bodies. <i>Pompanatius</i><span class="sni"><i>Pompan. lib. de incant. cap. 4.</i></span> writeth that the
    kings of <i>France</i> doo cure the disease called now the kings evill, or
    queenes evill; which hath beene alwaies thought, and to this daie is
    supposed to be a miraculous and a peculiar gift, &amp; a speciall grace

    proprietie of their persons, some to the peculiar gift of God, and some
    to the/<span class="snp" id="p_304"><i>304.</i></span> efficacie of words. But if the French king use it no woorsse
    than our Princesse doth, God will not be offended thereat: for hir
    maiestie onelie useth godlie and divine praier, with some almes, and
    referreth the cure to God and to the physician. <i>Plutarch</i><span class="sni"><i>Plutar. in vita Catonis.</i></span> writeth that
    there be certeine men called <i>Psilli</i>, which with their mouthes heale
    the bitings of serpents. And <i>J. Bap. Neap.</i><span class="sni"><i>J. Bap. Neap. in lib. de natur. magia. 1.</i></span> saith, that an olive being

    easilie be pulled out with the left hand, wheras with the right hand
    it cannot be remooved. Although this experiment, and such like, are
    like enough to be false; yet are they not altogether so impious as the
    miracles said to be done by characters, charmes, &amp;c. For manie strange
    properties remaine in sundrie partes of a living creature, which is

    recite infinite properties, wherewith God hath indued the bodie of man,
    worthie of admiration, and fit for this place. As touching other living
    creatures, God hath likewise (for his glorie, and our behoofe) bestowed
    most excellent and miraculous gifts and vertues upon their bodies and
    members, and that in severall and woonderfull wise. We see that a bone
    taken out of a carps head, stancheth bloud, and so doth none other
    part besides of th<span class="sni">Wonderfull naturall effects in bones of fishes, beasts, &amp;c.</span>at fish. The bone also in a hares foot mitigateth
    the crampe, as none other bone nor part else of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span> hare doth. How
    pretious is the bone growing out of the forehead of a unicorne; if the
    horne, which we see, growe there, which is doubted: and of how small
    accompt are the residue of all his bones? At the excellencie whereof,
    as also at the noble and innumerable vertues of herbs we muse not at
    all; bicause it hath pleased God to make them common unto us. Which
    perchance might in some part assist <i>Jannes</i> and <i>Jambres</i>, towards the
    hardning of <i>Pharaos</i> heart. But of such secret and strange operations

    am <i>Testis oculatus</i>, an eie witnesse; of the other I am so crediblie
    and certeinelie informed, that I dare and doo beleeve it to be verie

    his ambassage dispatched, a gentleman of his traine/<span class="snp" id="p_306"><i>306.</i></span> brought home a
    monument of great accompt, in nature and in propertie very wonderfull.
    And bicause I am loath to be long in the description of circumstances,
    I will first describe the thing it selfe: which was a peece of earth of
    a good quantitie, and most excellentlie proportioned in nature, having
    these qualities and vertues following. If one had taken a peece of
    perfect steele,<span class="sni">Strange properties in a peece of earth.</span>
    forked and sharpened at the end, and heated it red hot,
    offering therewith to have touched it; it would have fled with great
    celeritie: and on the other side, it would have pursued gold, either
    in coine or bulloine, with as great violence and speed as it shunned
    the other. No bird in the aire durst approch neere it; no beast of the
    field but feared it, and naturallie fled from the sight thereof. It
    would be here to daie, and to morrowe twentie miles off, and the next
    daie after in the verie place it was the first daie, and that without
    the helpe of anie other creature.</p>

    of <i>India</i>, which hath in it such a marvellous brightnes, puritie,
    and shining, that therewith the aire round about is so lightned and
    cleared, that one may see to read thereby in the darknes of night. It
    will not be conteined in a close roome, but requireth an open and

    earth, but alwaies laboureth to ascend up into the aire. If one presse
    it downe with his hand, it resisteth, and striketh verie sharpelie. It
    is beautifull to behold, without either spot or blemish, and yet verie
    unplesant to taste or feele. If anie part thereof be taken awaie, it
    is never a whit diminished, the forme thereof being inconstant, and at
    everie moment mutable. These two things last rehearsed are strange, and
    so long woondered at, as the mysterie and moralitie thereof remaineth
    undiscovered: but when I have disclosed the matter, and told you
    that by the lumpe of earth a man is ment, and some of his qualities
    described; and that that which was conteined in the farre fetcht stone,

    ended. And yet (I confesse) there is in these two creatures conteined
    more miraculous matter, than in all the loadstones and diamonds in
    the world. And hereby is to be noted, that even a part of this art,
    which is called naturall or witching magicke, consisteth as well in

    person is made beleeve, and will not sticke to affirme and sweare, that
    in the same church is such continuall light, that anie man may see to
    read there at all times of the night without a candle.</p>

  <p>An excellent philosopher, whome (for reverence unto his fame and
    learning) I will forbeare to name, was overtaken by his hostesse at
    <i>Dover</i>; who merrilie told him, that if he could reteine and keepe
    in his mouth certeine pibbles (lieng at the shore side) he should
    not perbreake untill he came to <i>Calice</i>, how rough and tempestuous
    so ever the seas were. Which when he had tried, and being not forced
    by sicknes to vomit, nor to lose his stones, as by vomiting he
    must needs doo, he thought his hostesse had discovered unto him an
    excellent secret, nothing doubting of hir amphibologicall speech: and
    therefore thought it a worthie note to be recorded among miraculous
    and medicinable stones; and inserted it accordinglie into his booke,
    among other experiments collected with great industrie, learning,
    travell, and judgement. All these toies helpe a subtill cousener/<span class="snp"><b>219.</b></span> to

    we shall ascribe such power and omnipotencie unto them, or unto the
    divell, as onelie and properlie apperteineth to God. As for example.
    By confederacie or cousenage (as before I have said) I may seeme to
    manifest the secret thoughts of the hart, which (as we learne in
    Gods booke) none knoweth or searcheth, but God himselfe alone. And
    therfore, whosoever beleeveth that I can doo as I may seeme to doo,
    maketh a god of me, and is an idolater. In which respect, whensoever
    we heare papist, witch, conjuror, or cousener, take upon him more than
    lieth in humane power to performe, we may know &amp; boldlie saie it is a
    knacke of knaverie; and no miracle at all. And further we may know,
    that when we understand it, it will not be woorth the knowing. And at
    the discoverie of these miraculous toies, we shall leave to wonder at
    them, and beginne to wonder at our selves, that could be so abused
    with/<span class="snp" id="p_312"><i>312.</i></span> bables. Howbeit, such things as God hath laid up secretlie in
    nature are to be weighed with great admiration, and to be

    out with such industrie, as may become a christian man: I meane, so
    as neither God, nor/<span class="snp"><b>220.</b></span> our neighbour be offended thereby, which respect
    doubtlesse <i>Jannes</i> and <i>Jambres</i> never had. We find in the scriptures
    diverse naturall and secret experiments practised; as namelie that of
    <i>Jacob</i>, for pied sheepe: which are confirmed by prophane authors,
    and not onelie verified in lambs and sheepe, but in horsses, pecocks,
    connies, &amp;c. We read also of a woman that brought foorth a yoong blacke
    Moore, by meanes of an old blacke Moore<span class="sni"><i>J. Bap. Neapol.

    doo saie, that they have seene these to descend in raine, so as they
    have lien and cralled on the tops of houses, &amp;c. Also <i>Aelianus</i> dooth
    saie, that he sawe frogs and todes, whereof the heads &amp; shoulders were
    alive, &amp; became flesh; the hinder parts being but earth, &amp; so cralled
    on two feete, the other being not yet fashioned or fullie framed. And
    <i>Macrobius</i> reporteth, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
    that in <i>Aegypt</i>, mice growe of earth and
    shewers; as also frogs, todes, and serpents in other places. They
    saie that <i>Danmatus Hispanus</i> could make them when &amp; as manie as he
    listed. He is no good angler, that knoweth not how soone the entrales

    Whosoever knoweth the order of preserving silkewormes, may perceive a
    like conclusion: bicause in the winter, that is a dead seed, which in
    the summer is a livelie creature. Such and greater experiments might
    be knowne to <i>Jannes</i> and <i>Jambres</i>, and serve well to their purpose,
    especiallie with such excuses, delaies, and cunning, as they could
    joine therewithall. But to proceed, and come a little neerer to their
    feats, and to shew you a knacke beyond their cunning; I can assure you
    that of the fat of a man or a woman, lice are in verie short space
    ingendered: and yet I saie, <i>Pharaos</i> magicians could not make them,
    with all the cunning they had. Whereby you may perceive, that God
    indeed performed the other actions, to indurate <i>Pharao</i>, though he
    thought his magicians did with no lesse dexteritie than <i>Moses</i> worke
    <span class="sni"><i>Giles. Alley</i>: See the poore mans librarie.</span>
    miracles and woonders. But some of the interpretors of that place
    excuse their ignorance in that matter, thus; The divell (saie they) can
    make no creature under the quantitie of a barlie corne, and lice being
    so little cannot therefore be created by them. As though he that can
    make the greater, could not make the lesse. A verie grosse absurditie.
    And as though that he which hath power over great, had not the like over small.//</p>

    students in those magicall arts, which in these countries and in this
    age is rather prohibited than allowed, by reason of the abuse commonlie
    coupled therewith; which in truth is it that mooveth admiration and
    estimation of miraculous workings. As for example. If I affirme, that
    with certeine charmes and popish praiers I can set an horsse or an
    asses head upon a mans shoulders, I shall not be beleeved; or if I doo
    it, I shall be thought a witch. And yet if <i>J. Bap. Neap.
    </i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span> experiments
    be true, <span class="sni">Wonderfull experiments.</span>it is no difficult matter to make it seeme so: and the charme
    of a witch or papist joined with the experiment, will also make the
    woonder seeme to proceed thereof. The words used in such case are
    uncerteine, and to be recited at the pleasure of the witch or cousener.
    But the conclusion is this: Cut off the head of a horsse or an asse
    (before they be dead) otherwise the vertue or strength thereof will be
    the lesse effectuall,<span class="sni">To set an horsses or an asses head on a mans neck and
    shoulders,</span> and make an earthern vessell of fit capacitie to
    conteine the same, and let it be filled with the oile and fat therof;
    cover it close, and dawbe it over with lome: let it boile over a soft
    fier three daies continuallie, that the flesh boiled may run into oile,
    so as the bare bones may be seene: beate the haire into powder, and
    mingle the same with the oile; and annoint the heads of the standers
    by, and they shall seeme to have horsses or asses heads. If beasts
    heads be annointed with the like oile made of a mans head, they shall
    seeme to have mens faces, as diverse authors soberlie affirme. If a
    lampe be annointed heerewith, everie thing shall seeme most monstrous.
    It is also written, that if that which is called <i>Sperma</i> in anie beast
    be bur/ned,<span class="snp" id="p_316"><i>316.</i></span> and anie bodies face therewithall annointed, he shall seeme
    to have the like face as the beast had. But if you beate arsenicke
    verie fine, and boile it with a little sulphur in a covered pot, and
    kindle it with a new candle, the standers by will seeme to be hedlesse.
    Aqua composita and salt being fiered in the night, and all other
    lights extinguished, make the standers by seeme as dead. All these
    things might be verie well perceived and knowne, and also practised
    by <i>Jannes</i> and <i>Jambres</i>. But the woonderous devises, and miraculous
    sights and conceipts made and conteined in glasse,<span class="sni">Strange

    other; whereto the art perspective is verie necessarie. For it sheweth
    the illusions of them, whose experiments be seene in diverse sorts of

    the pyramidate or piked, the turbinall, the bounched, the round, the
    cornerd, the inversed, the eversed, the massie, the regular, the
    irregular, the coloured and cleare glasses: for you may have glasses so

    be glasses also, wherein one man may see another mans image, and not
    his owne; others, to make manie similitudes; others, to make none at

    the thing most worthie of admiration concerning these glasses, is,
    that the lesser glass dooth lessen/<span class="snp" id="p_317"><i>317.</i></span> the shape: but how big so ever it

    and have the receipt how to make them: which, if desire of brevitie
    had not forbidden me, I would here have set downe. But I thinke not
    but <i>Pharaos</i> magicians had better experience than I for those and
    such like devises. And (as <i>Pompanacius</i> saith) it is most true, that

    HUS you see that it hath pleased GOD to shew unto men that seeke for
    knowledge, such cunning in finding out, compounding, and framing of
    strange and secret things, as thereby he seemeth to have bestowed upon
    man, some part of his divinitie. Howbeit, God (of nothing, with his
    word) hath created all things, and dooth at his will, beyond the power
    and also the reach of man, accomplish whatsoever he list. And such
    miracles in times past he wrought by the hands of his prophets, as
    here he did by <i>Moses</i><span class="sni">An apish imitation in Jannes and Jambres of working
    woonders.</span> in the presence of <i>Pharao</i>, which <i>Jannes</i> and
    <i>Jambres</i> apishlie followed. But to affirme that they by themselves,
    or by all the divels in hell, could doo indeed as <i>Moses</i> did by the
    power of the Holie-ghost, is woorsse than infidelitie. If anie object
    and saie, that our witches can doo such feats with words and charms,
    as <i>Pharaos</i> magicians did by their art, I denie it; and all the world
    will never be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
    able to shew it.<span class="sni"><i>Jo. Calvine, lib. institut. 1. cap. 8.<br />Cle. recog. 3.</i></span>
    That which they did, was openlie done;
    as our witches and conjurors never doo anie/<span class="snp"><b>224.</b></span> thing: so as these cannot
    doo as they did. And yet (as <i>Calvine</i> saith of them) they were but
    jugglers. Neither could they doo, as manie/<span class="snp" id="p_318"><i>318.</i></span> suppose. For as <i>Clemens</i>
    saith; These magicians did rather seeme to doo these woonders, than
    worke them indeed. And if they made but prestigious shewes of things,
    I saie it was more than our witches can doo. For witchcrafts (as
    <i>Erastus</i><span class="sni"><i>Erast. in disputat. de lamiis.</i></span> himselfe confesseth in drift of argument) are but old wives
    fables. If the magicians serpent had beene a verie serpent, it must
    needs have beene transformed out of the rod. And therein had beene
    a double worke of God; to wit, the qualifieng and extinguishment of
    one substance, and the creation of another. Which are<span class="sni">Actions
    unpossible to divels: <i>Ergo</i> to witches conjurors, &amp;c.</span> actions beyond
    the divels power, for he can neither make a bodie to be no bodie, nor
    yet no bodie to be a bodie; as to make something nothing, and nothing
    something; and contrarie things, one: naie, they cannot make one haire
    either white or blacke.*<span class="sni">[* Matt. 5, 36]</span>
    If <i>Pharaos</i> magicians had made verie
    frogs upon a sudden, whie could they not drive them awaie againe? If
    they could not hurt the frogs, whie should we thinke that they could
    make them? Or that our witches, which cannot doo so much as counterfet
    them, can kill cattell and other creatures with words or wishes? And
    therefore I saie with <i>Jamblichus</i>, <span class="sni"><i>Jamb. de mysteriis.</i></span><i>Quæ fascinati imaginamur, præter
      imaginamenta nullā habent actionis &amp; essentiæ veritatem</i>; Such things

    I thinke there were no inconvenience granted, though I
    should admit that the serpent and frogs were truelie presented, and
    the water truelie poisoned by <i>Jannes</i> and <i>Jambres</i>;<span class="sni">Pharaos
    magicians were not maisters of their owne actions.</span> not that they
    could execute such miracles of themselves, or by their familiars or
    divels: but that God, by the hands of those counterfet couseners,
    contrarie to their owne expectations, overtooke them, and compelled
    them in their ridiculous wickednes to be/<span class="snp" id="p_319"><i>319.</i></span> instruments of his will and
    vengeance, upon their maister <i>Pharao</i>: so as by their hands God shewed
    some miracles, which he himselfe <span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
    wrought: as appeareth in <i>Exodus</i>.<span class="sni">Exod. 10.</span>
    For God did put the spirit of truth into <i>Baalams</i> mouth, who was
    hiered to cursse his people. And although he were a corrupt and false
    prophet, and went about a mischeevous enterprise;<span class="sni">God
    useth the wicked as instruments to execute his counsels
    &amp; judgments.</span> yet God made him an
    instrument (against his will) to the confusion of the wicked. Which if
    it pleased God to doo here, as a speciall worke, whereby to shew his
    omnipotencie, to the confirmation of his peoples faith, in the doctrine
    of their Messias delivered unto them by the prophet <i>Moses</i>, then was
    it miraculous and extraordinarie, and not to be looked for now. And
    (as some suppose) there were then a consort or crew of false prophets,
    which could also foretell things to come, and worke miracles. I answer,
    it was extraordinarie and miraculous, &amp; that it pleased God so/<span class="snp"><b>225.</b></span> to
    trie his people; but he worketh not so in these daies: for the working
    of miracles is ceased. <span class="sni">The contrarie effects that the miracles of Moses and the
    miracles of the Aegyptian magiciās wroght in the hart of Pharao.</span>Likewise in this case it might well stand
    with Gods glorie, to use the hands of <i>Pharaos</i> magicians, towards
    the hardening of their maisters hart; and to make their illusions
    and ridiculous conceipts to become effectuall. For God had promised
    and determined to harden the heart of <i>Pharao</i>. As for the miracles
    which <i>Moses</i> did, they mollified it so, as he alwaies relented upon
    the sight of the same. For unto the greatnesse of his miracles were
    added such modestie and patience, as might have mooved even a heart
    of steele or flint. But <i>Pharaos</i> frowardnes alwaies grew upon the
    magicians actions: the like example, or the resemblance whereof, we
    find not againe in the scriptures. And though there were such people
    in those daies suffered and used by God, for the accomplishment of his
    will and secret purpose: yet it followeth not, that now, when Gods
    will is wholie revealed unto us in his word, and his sonne exhibited
    (for whome, or rather for the manifestation of whose comming all those
    things were suffered or wrought) such things and such people should
    yet continue. So as I conclude, the cause being taken awaie, the
    thing proceeding thence remaineth not. And to assigne our witches and
    conjurors their roome, is to mocke and contemne Gods woonderfull works;
    and to oppose against them cousenages, juggling knacks, and things
    of nought. And therefore, as they must/<span class="snp" id="p_320"><i>320.</i></span> confesse, that none in these
    daies can doo as <i>Moses</i> did: so it may be answered, that none in these
    daies can doo as <i>Jannes</i> and <i>Jambres</i> did: who, if they had beene
    false prophets, as they were jugglers, had yet beene more privileged to
    exceed our old women or conjurors, in the accomplishing of miracles,
    or in prophesieng, &amp;c. For who may be compared with <i>Balaam</i>? Naie,
    I dare saie, that <i>Balaams</i> asse wrought a greater miracle, and more
    supernaturall, than either the pope or all the conjurors and witches in
    the world can doo at this daie.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

  <p><span class="sni">That the art of juggling is more, or at least no les strange
    in working miracles than conjuring, witchcraft, &amp;c.</span>To conclude, it is to be avouched (and there be proofes manifest
    enough) that our jugglers approch much neerer to resemble <i>Pharaos</i>
    magicians, than either witches or conjurors, &amp; can make a more
    livelie shew of working miracles than anie inchantors can doo: for
    these practise to shew that in action, which witches doo in words and
    termes. But that you may thinke I have reason for the maintenance of
    mine opinion in this behalfe, I will surcease by multitude of words
    to amplifie this place, referring you to the tract following of the

    them to be set foorth in forme and figure, that your understanding
    might be somewhat helped by instrumentall demonstrations. And when you
    have perused that whole discoverie of juggling, compare the wonders
    thereof with the woonders imputed to conjurors and witches, (not
    omitting <i>Pharaos</i> sorcerers at anie hand in this comparison) and I
    beleeve you will be resolved, that the miracles doone in <i>Pharaos</i>
    sight by them, and the miracles ascribed unto witches, conjurors, &amp;c:

    card either in the bottome, or in some knowne place of the stocke,
    foure or five cards from it. Hereby you shall seeme to worke woonders;
    for it will be easie for you to see or spie one card, which though you
    be perceived to doo, it will not be suspected, if you shuffle them
    well afterwards. <span class="sni">Note.</span>And this note I must give you, that in reserving the
    bottome card, you must alwaies (whilest you shuffle) keepe him a little
    before or a little behind all the cards lieng underneath him, bestowing
    him (I saie) either a little beyond his fellowes before, right over
    the forefinger, or else behind the rest, so as the little
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span> finger of
    the left hand may meete with it: which is the easier, the readier,
    and the better waie. In the beginning of your shuffling, shuffle as
    thicke as you can; and in the end throw upon the stocke the nether card
    (with so manie mo at the least as you would have preserved for anie
    purpose) a little before or behind the rest. Provided alwaies, that
    your forefinger, if the packe be laied before, or the little finger, if
    the packe lie be/hind,<span class="snp" id="p_333"><i>333.</i></span> creepe up to meete with the bottome card, and
    not lie betwixt the cards: and when you feele it, you may there hold
    it, untill you have shuffled over the cards againe, still leaving your
    kept card below. Being perfect herein, you may doo almost what you list
    with the cards. By this meanes, what packe soever you make, though it
    consist of eight, twelve, or twentie cards, you may keepe them still
    together unsevered next to the nether card, and yet shuffle them often
    to satisfie the curious beholders. As for example, and for brevities
    sake, to shew you diverse feats under one.</p>

  <h4><i>How to deliver out foure aces, and to convert them into foure knaves.</i></h4>

  <p class="drop-cap">MAke a packe of these eight cards; to wit, foure knaves and foure aces:
    and although all the eight cards must lie immediatlie together, yet
    must ech knave and ace be evenlie severed, and the same eight cards
    must lie also in the lowest place of the bunch. <span class="sni">You
    must be well advised in the shuffling of the bunch,
    least you overshoot your selfe.</span>Then shuffle them so,
    as alwaies at the second shuffling, or at least wise at the end of your
    shuffling the said packe, and of the packe one ace may lie nethermost,
    or so as you may know where he goeth and lieth: and alwaies (I saie)
    let your foresaid packe with three or foure cards more lie unseparablie
    together immediatlie upon and with that ace. Then using some speech or
    other devise, and putting your hands with the cards to the edge of the
    table to hide the action, let out privilie a peece of the second card,
    which is one of the knaves, holding/<span class="snp"><b>235.</b></span> foorth the stocke in both your
    hands, and shewing to the standers by the nether card (which is the ace
    or kept card) covering also the head or peece of the knave (which is
    the next card) with your foure fingers, draw out the same knave, laieng
    it downe on the table: then shuffle againe, keeping your packe whole,
    and so have you two aces lieng together in the bottome. And therfore,
    to reforme that disordered card, as also for a grace and countenance
    to that action, take off the uppermost card of the bunch, and thrust
    it into the middest of the cards; and then take awaie the nethermost
    card, which is one of your said aces, and bestow him likewise. Then may
    you begin as before, shewing an other ace, and in steed thereof, laie
    downe an other knave: and so foorth, untill in steed of foure aces you/<span class="snp" id="p_334"><i>334.</i></span>
    have laied downe foure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
    knaves. The beholders all this while thinking
    that there lie foure aces on the table, are greatlie abused, and will
    marvell at the transformation.</p>

  <h4><i>How to tell one what card he seeth in the bottome, when the same card
    is shuffled into the stocke.</i></h4>

  <p class="drop-cap">WHen you have seene a card privilie, or as though you marked it not,
    laie the same undermost, and shuffle the cards as before you are
    taught, till your card lie againe below in the bottome. Then shew the
    same to the beholders, willing them to remember it: then shuffle the
    cards, or let anie other shuffle them; for you know the card alreadie,
    and therefore may at anie time tell them what card they saw:
    which*<span class="sni">* For that will drawe the action into the greater admiration.</span>
    neverthelesse would be done with great circumstance and shew of
    difficultie.</p>

  <h4><i>An other waie to doo the same, having your selfe indeed never seene
    the card.</i></h4>

  <p class="drop-cap">IF you can see no card, or be suspected to have seene that which you
    meane to shew, then let a stander by first shuffle, and afterwards take
    you the cards into your hands, and (having shewed and not seene the
    bottome card) shuffle againe, and keepe the same card, as before you
    are taught; and either make shift then to see it when their suspicion
    is past, which maie be done by letting some cards fall, or else laie
    downe all the cards in heaps, remembring where you laid your bottome
    card. Then spie how manie cards lie in some one heape, and laie the
    heape where your bottome card is upon that heape, and all the other
    heapes upon the same: and so, if there were five cards in the heape
    wheron you laied your card, then the same must be the sixt card, which
    now you may throw out, or looke upon without suspicion: and tell them
    the card they saw.</p>

  <h4><i>To tell one without confederacie what card he thinketh.</i></h4>

  <p class="drop-cap">LAie three cards on a table, a little waie distant, and bid a stander
    by be true and not waver, <span class="sni">The eie bewraieth the thought.</span>but

    tedious, nor of their fortune telling which is so impious; and yet both
    of them meere cousenages. <span class="sni">Fast and loose with a handkercher.</span>¶
    Make one plaine loose knot, with the two
    corner ends of a handkercher, and seeming to draw the same verie hard,
    hold fast the bodie of the said handkercher (neere to the knot) with
    your right hand, pulling the contrarie end with the left hand, which is
    the corner of that which you hold. Then close up handsomlie the knot,
    which will be yet somewhat loose, and pull the handkercher so with your
    right hand, as the left hand end may be neere to the knot: then will it
    seeme a true and a firme knot. And to make it appeare more assuredlie
    to be so indeed, let a stranger pull at the end which you hold in your
    left hand, whilest you hold fast the other in your right hand: and then
    holding the knot with your forefinger &amp; thombe, &amp; the nether part of
    your handkercher with your other fingers,/<span class="snp" id="p_337"><i>337.</i></span> as you hold a bridle when
    you would with one hand slip up the knot and lengthen your reines. This
    doone, turne your handkercher over the knot with the left hand, in
    dooing whereof you must suddenlie slip out the end or corner, putting
    up the knot of your handkercher with your forefinger and thombe, as
    you would put up the foresaid knot of your bridle. Then deliver the
    same (covered and wrapt in the middest of your handkercher) to one, to
    hold fast, and so after some words used, and wagers laied, take the
    handkercher and shake it, and it will be loose.</p>

  <h4><i>A notable feate of fast or loose; namelie, to pull three
    beadstones from off a cord, while you hold fast the ends
    thereof, without remooving of your hand.</i></h4>

  <p class="drop-cap">TAke <span class="sni">Fast or lose with whipcords and beades.</span>two little whipcords of two foote long a peece, double them
    equallie, so as there may appeare foure ends. Then take three great

    put one beadstone upon the eie or bowt of the one
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span> cord, and an other
    on the other cord. Then take the stone with the greatest hole, and let
    both the bowts be hidden therein: which may be the better doone, if you
    put the eie of the one into the eie or bowt of the other. Then pull
    the middle bead upon the same, being doubled over his fellow, and so
    will the beads seeme to be put over the two cords without partition.
    For holding fast in each hand the two ends of the two cords, you may
    tosse them as you list, and make it seeme manifest to the beholders,
    which may not see how you have doone it, that the beadstons are put
    upon the two cords without anie fraud. Then must you seeme to adde

    thred, and hold it foorth at length, betwixt the forefinger and thombe
    of each hand, holding all your fingers deintilie, as yong gentlewomen
    are taught to take up a morsell of meate.<span class="sni">That is,
    neatlie and deintilie.</span> Then let one cut asunder the
    same thred in the middle. When that is doone, put the tops of your
    two thombes together, and so shall you with lesse suspicion receive
    the peece of thred which you hold in your right hand into your left,
    without opening of your left finger and thombe: then holding these two
    peeces as you did the same before it was cut, let those two be cut also
    asunder in the middest, and they conveied againe as before, untill
    they be cut verie short, and then roll all those ends together, and
    keepe that ball of short threds before the other in your left hand,
    and with a knife thrust out the same into a candle, where you may hold
    it untill the said ball of short threds be burnt to ashes. Then pull
    backe the knife with your right hand, and leave the ashes with the
    other ball betwixt the forefinger and thombe of your left hand, and
    with the two thombs &amp; two forefingers together seeme to take paines to

  <p class="drop-img">

    are a thousand jugglings, which I am loth to spend time to

    but deceipt, cousenage, or confederacie:<span class="sni">Juggling a kind of witchcraft.</span> whereby you may plainelie
    see the art to be a kind of witchcraft. I will end therfore with one
    devise, which is not common, but was speciallie used by <i>Clarvis</i>,<span class="sni">The invention of Clarvis.</span>
    whome though I never saw to exercise the feat, yet am I sure I conceive
    aright of that invention. He had (they/<span class="snp" id="p_344"><i>344.</i></span> saie) a booke, whereof he would
    make you thinke first, that everie leafe was cleane white paper: then
    by vertue of words he would shew you everie leafe to be painted with
    birds, then with beasts, then with serpents, then with angels, &amp;c: the
    devise thereof is this. <span class="sni">This knack is sooner learned by demonstrative means, than
    taught by words of instruction.</span>¶ Make a booke seven inches long, and five
    inches broad, or according to that proportion: and let there be xlix,
    leaves; to wit, seven times seven conteined therin, so as you may cut
    upon the edge of each leafe six notches, each notch in depth halfe a
    quarter of an inch, and one inch distant. Paint everie foureteenth and
    fifteenth page (which is the end of everie sixt leafe, &amp; the beginning
    of everie seventh) with like colour, or one kind of picture. Cut off
    with a paire of sheares everie notch of the first leafe, leaving onlie
    one inch of paper in the uppermost place uncut, which will remaine
    almost halfe a quarter of an inch higher than anie part of that leafe.
    Leave an other like inch in the second place of the second leafe,
    clipping away one inch of paper in the highest place immediatlie above
    it, and all the notches below the same, and so orderlie to the third,
    fourth, &amp;c: so as there shall rest upon each leafe one onlie inch of
    paper above the rest. One high uncut inch of paper must answer to the
    first, directlie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
    in everie seventh leafe of the booke: so as when you
    have cut the first seven leaves, in such sort as I first described,/<span class="snp"><b>243.</b></span>
    you are to begin in the selfe same order at the eight leafe, descending
    in such wise in the cutting of seven other leaves, and so againe at the
    fifteenth, to xxi, &amp;c: untill you have passed through everie leafe, all
    the thicknes of your booke.</p>

  <p>Now you shall understand, that after the first seven leaves, everie
    seventh leafe in the booke is to be painted, saving one seven leaves,
    which must remaine white. Howbeit you must observe, that at each
    Bumleafe or high inch of paper, seven leaves distant, opposite one
    directlie and lineallie against the other, through the thicknesse of
    the booke, the same page with the page precedent so to be painted with
    the like colour or picture; and so must you passe through the booke
    with seven severall sorts of colours or pictures: so as, when you shall
    rest your thombe upon anie of those Bumleaves, or high inches, and open
    the booke,<span class="sni">This will seeme rare to the beholders.</span>
    you shall see in each page one colour or picture through out
    the booke; in an other rowe, an other colour, &amp;c. To make that matter
    more plaine unto you, let this be the description hereof. Hold the
    booke/<span class="snp" id="p_345"><i>345.</i></span> with your left hand, and (betwixt your forefinger and thombe of
    your right hand) slip over the booke in what place you list, and your
    thombe will alwaies rest at the seventh leafe; to wit, at the Bumleafe
    or high inch of paper from whence when your booke is streined, it will
    fall or slip to the next, &amp;c. Which when you hold fast, &amp; open the
    booke, the beholders seeing each leafe to have one colour or picture
    with so manie varieties, all passing continuallie &amp; directlie thrugh
    the whole booke, will suppose that with words you can discolour the
    leaves at your pleasure. <span class="sni">Wher such bookes may be gotten.</span>But
    because perhaps you will hardlie conceive
    herof by this description, you shall (if you be disposed) see or buie
    for a small value the like booke, at the shop of <i>W. Brome</i> in Powles
    churchyard, for your further instruction. ¶ There are certeine feats
    of activitie, which beautifie this art exceedinglie: howbeit even in
    these, some are true, and some are counterfet; to wit, some done by
    practise, and some by confederacie. ¶ There are likewise divers feats
    arythmeticall &amp; geometricall: for them read <i>Gemma Phrysius</i>, and

    <i>Albert</i>, <i>Joh. Bap. Port. Neap.</i> and <i>Thomas Lupton</i>, wherof some are
    true, and some false: which being knowne to <i>Jannes</i> and <i>Jambres</i>, or
    else to our jugglers, their occupation is the more magnified, and they
    thereby more reverenced.<span class="sni">See more hereof in the 11. book of this discoverie, in the

    of the end of each planke halfe a hole; so as both planks being thrust
    togither, there may remaine two holes, like to the holes in a paire of

    must leane or lie upon the boord, and must put his head under the boord

    cord, the same being put on the nose like a paire of tongs or pinsars;
    and the cord, which goeth round about the same, being drawne to and
    fro, the beholders will thinke the cord to go through your nose verie
    dangerouslie. The knots at the end of the cord, which doo staie the
    same from being drawne out of the sticke, may not be put out at the
    verie top (for that must be stopped up) but halfe an inch beneath each
    end: and so I saie, when it is pulled, it will seeme to passe through
    the nose; and then may you take a knife, and seeme to cut the cord
    asunder, and pull the bridle from your nose./</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">HErein I might wade infinitelie, but I hope it sufficeth, that I have
    delivered unto you the principles, and also the principall feats
    belonging to this art of juggling; so as any man conceiving throughlie
    hereof may not onlie doo all these things, but also may devise other
    as strange, &amp; varie everie of these devises into other formes as he
    can best conceive. And so long as the power of almightie God is not
    transposed to the juggler, nor offense ministred by his uncomlie speach
    and behaviour, but the action performed in pastime, to the delight
    of the beholders, so as alwaies the juggler confesse in the end that
    these are no supernaturall actions, but devises of men, and nimble
    conveiances, let all such curious conceipted men as cannot affoord
    their neighbors anie comfort or commoditie, but such as
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span> pleaseth their
    melancholike dispositions say what they list, for this will not onelie
    be found among indifferent actions,<span class="sni">Among what actions
    juggling is to be counted.</span> but such as greatlie advance the
    power and glorie of God, discovering their pride and falshood that take
    upon them to worke miracles, and to be the mightie power of God, as
    <i>Jannes</i> and <i>Jambres</i> and also <i>Simon Magus</i> did.</p>

  <p>If anie man doubt of these things, as whether they be not as/<span class="snp" id="p_352"><i>352.</i></span> strange
    to behold as I have reported, or thinke with <i>Bodin</i> that these matters
    are performed by familiars or divels; let him go into S. Martins, and
    inquire for one <i>John Cautares</i><span class="sni">A matchles fellowe
    for legierdemaine.</span> (a French man by birth, in conversation
    an honest man) and he will shew as much and as strange actions as
    these, who getteth not his living hereby, but laboureth for the same
    with the sweat of his browes, and neverthelesse hath the best hand and
    conveiance (I thinke) of anie man that liveth this daie.</p>

  <p>Neither doo I speake (as they saie) without booke herein. For if
    time, place, and occasion serve, I can shew so much herein, as I am
    sure <i>Bodin</i>, <i>Spinæus</i>, and <i>Vairus</i>, would sweare I were a witch,
    and had a familiar divell at commandement. But truelie my studie and
    travell herein hath onelie beene emploied to the end I might proove
    them fooles, and find out the fraud of them that make them fooles,
    as whereby they may become wiser, and God may have that which to him
    belongeth.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Touching the patternes of diverse juggling instruments.</span>
    And bicause the maner of these juggling conveiances are not easilie
    conceived by discourse of words; I have caused to be set downe diverse
    formes of instruments used in this art; which may serve for patternes
    to them that would throughlie see the secrets thereof, and make them
    for their owne private practises, to trie the event of such devises,
    as in this tract of legierdemaine are shewed. Where note, that you
    shall find everie instrument that is most necessarilie occupied in the
    working of these strange feats, to beare the just and true number of
    the page, where the use thereof is in ample words declared.</p>

  <p>Now will I proceed with another cousening point of witchcraft, apt for
    the place, necessarie for the time, and in mine opinion meet to be
    discovered, or at the least to be defaced among deceitfull arts. And
    bicause manie are abused heereby to their utter undooing, for
    that it hath had passage under the protection of learn-
    ing, wherby they pretend to accomplish their
    works, it hath gone freelie with-

  <p>The tale of the chanons yeoman published by <i>Chaucer</i>, dooth make (by
    waie of example) a perfect demonstration of the art of Alcumystrie
    or multiplication: the effect whereof is this. A chanon being an
    Alcumyster<span class="sni">The points or parts of the art Alcumysticall which may be
    called the mystie or smokie science.</span> or cousenor, espied a covetous preest, whose pursse he knew
    to be well lined, whome he assaulted with flatterie and subtill speach,
    two principall points belonging to this art. At the length he borrowed
    monie of the preest, which is the third part of the art, without the
    which the professors can doo no good, nor indure in good estate. Then
    he at his daie repaied the monie, which is the most difficult point
    in this art, and a rare experiment. Finallie, to requite the preests
    courtesie, he promised unto him such instructions,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>as wherby with
    expedition he should become infinitelie rich, and all through this art
    of multiplication. And this is the most common point in this science;
    for herein they must be skilfull before they can be famous, or atteine
    to anie credit. The preest disliked not his proffer; speciallie bicause
    it tended to his profit, and embraced his courtesie. Then the chanon
    willed him foorthwith to send for three ownces of quicke silver, which
    he said he would transubstantiate (by his art) into perfect silver. The
    preest thought that a man of his profession could not dissemble, and
    therefore with great joy and hope accomplished his request./</p>

  <p><span class="snp" id="p_357"><i>357.</i></span>And now (forsooth) goeth this jollie Alcumyst about his busines and
    worke of multiplication, and causeth the preest to make a fier of
    coles, in the bottome whereof he placeth a croslet; and pretending
    onelie to helpe the preest to laie the coles handsomelie, he foisteth
    into the middle ward or lane of coles, a beechen cole, within the which
    was conveied an ingot of perfect silver, which (when the cole was
    consumed) slipt downe into the croslet, that was (I saie) directlie
    under it. The preest<span class="sni">The Alcumysts bait to catch a foole.</span> perceived not the fraud, but received the ingot
    of silver, and was not a little joy/full<span class="snp"><b>252.</b></span> to see such certeine successe
    proceed from his owne handie worke wherein could be no fraud (as he
    surelie conceived) and therefore verie willinglie gave the cannon
    fortie pounds for the receipt of this experiment, who for that summe
    of monie taught him a lesson in Alcumystrie, but he never returned to
    heare repetitions, or to see how he profited.</p>

    &nbsp;COULD cite manie Alcumysticall cousenages wrought by Doctor <i>Burcot</i>,
    <i>Feates</i>, and such other; but I will passe them over, and onelie
    repeate three experiments of that art; the one practised upon an honest
    yeoman in the countie of <i>Kent</i>, the other upon a mightie prince,
    the third upon a covetous preest. And first touching the yeoman, he
    was overtaken and used in maner and forme following, by a notable
    cousening varlot, who professed Alcumystrie, juggling, witchcraft,
    and conjuration: and by meanes of his companions and confederats
    discussed the simplicitie and abilitie of the said yeoman, and found
    out his estate and humor to be convenient for his purpose; and finallie
    came a wooing (as they saie) to his daughter, to whome he made
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span> love
    cunninglie in words, though his purpose tended to another matter. And
    among other illusions and tales, concerning his owne/<span class="snp" id="p_358"><i>358.</i></span> commendation,
    for welth, parentage, inheritance, alliance, activitie, learning,
    pregnancie, and cunning, he boasted of his knowledge and experience in
    Alcumystrie; making the simple man beleeve that he could multiplie,
    and of one angell make two or three. Which seemed strange to the poore
    man, in so much as he became willing enough to see that conclusion:
    whereby the Alcumyster had more hope and comfort to atteine his desire,
    than if his daughter had yeelded to have maried him. To be short, he
    in the presence of the said yeoman, <span class="sni">Note the cousening conveiance of this alcumystical
    practitioner.</span>did include within a little ball
    of virgine wax, a couple of angels; and after certeine ceremonies and
    conjuring words he seemed to deliver the same unto him: but in truth
    (through legierdemaine) he conveied into the yeomans hand another ball
    of the same scantling, wherein were inclosed manie more angels than
    were in the ball which he thought he had received. Now (forsooth)
    the Alcumyster bad him laie up the same ball of wax, and also use
    certeine ceremonies (which I thought good heere to omit). And after
    certeine daies, houres, and minuts they returned together, according
    to the appointment, and found great gaines by the multiplication of
    the angels. Insomuch as he, being a plaine man, was heereby persuaded,
    that he should not onelie have a rare and notable good sonne in lawe;
    but a companion that might helpe to adde unto his welth much treasure,
    and to his estate great fortune and felicitie. And to increase this
    opinion in him, as also to winne his further favour; but speciallie to
    bring his cunning Alcumystrie, or rather his lewd purpose to passe;
    he told him that it were follie to multiplie a pound of gold, when as
    easilie they might multiplie a millian: and therefore counselled him/<span class="snp"><b>253.</b></span>
    to produce all the monie he had, or could borrowe of his neighbours
    and freends; and did put him out of doubt, that he would multiplie the
    same, and redouble it exceedinglie, even as he sawe by experience<span class="sni">A notable foole.</span> how
    he delt with the small summe before his face. This yeoman, in hope of
    gaines and preferment, &amp;c: consented to this sweete motion, and brought
    out and laid before his feete, not the one halfe of his goods, but all
    that he had, or could make or borrowe anie maner of waie. Then this
    juggling Alcumyster, having obteined his purpose, folded the same in
    a ball, in quantitie farre bigger than the other, and conveieng the

    ech other. Now (forsooth) these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>

    (belike) having other matters of more importance came not just at the
    houre appointed, nor yet at the daie, nor within the yeare: so as,
    although it were somewhat against the yeomans conscience to violate
    his promise, or breake the league; yet partlie by the longing he had
    to see, and partlie the desire he had to enjoie the fruit of that
    excellent experiment, having (for his owne securitie) and the others
    satisfaction, some testimonie at the opening thereof, to witnesse his
    sincere dealing, he brake up the coffer, and lo he soone espied the
    ball of wax, which he himselfe had laid up there with his owne hand.
    So as he thought (if the hardest should fall) he should find his
    principall: and whie not as good increase hereof now, as of the other
    before. But alas! when the wax was broken, and the metall discovered,
    the gold was much abased, and beecame perfect lead.</p>

    receive by vertue of the kings warrant, a great summe
    of monie in prest, assuring the king and his councell, that he would
    shortlie returne, and accomplish his promise, &amp;c. Soone after, the
    kings foole, among other jestes, fell into a discourse and discoverie
    of fooles, and handled that common place so pleasantlie, that the king
    began to take delight therein, &amp; to like his merrie veine. Whereupon
    he would needes have the foole deliver unto him a schedull or scroll,
    conteining the names of all the most excellent fooles in the land.</p>

  <p>So he caused the kings name to be first set downe, and next him all
    the names of the lords of his privie councell. The king seeing him so
    sawcie and malepert, ment to have had him punished: but some of his
    councell, knowing him to be a fellow pleasantlie conceipted, besought
    his majestie rather to demand of him a reason of his libell, &amp;c: than
    to proceed in extremitie against him.<span class="sni">A wise foole.</span> Then the foole being asked why

    answered; Bicause he sawe one foolish knave beguile them all, and to
    cousen them of so great a masse of monie, and finallie to be gone out
    of their reach. Why (said one of the councell) he maie returne and
    performe his promise, &amp;c. Then (quoth the foole) I can helpe all the
    matter easilie. How (said the king) canst thou doo that? Marie sir

    third example is reported by <i>Erasmus</i>, whose excellent learning
    and wit is had to this daie in admiration. He in a certeine dialog
    intituled <i>Alcumystica</i> doth finelie bewraie the knaverie of this
    craftie art;/<span class="snp"><b>255.</b></span> wherein he proposeth one <i>Balbine</i>, a verie wise,
    learned, and devout preest, howbeit such a one as was bewitched, and
    mad upon the art of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
    Alcumystrie. Which thing another cousening preest
    perceived, and dealt with him in maner and forme following.</p>

  <p>M. Doctor <i>Balbine</i><span class="sni">A flattering &amp; clawing preamble.</span> (said he) I being a stranger unto you maie seeme
    verie saucie to trouble your worship with my bold sute, who alwaies are
    busied in great and divine studies. To whome <i>Balbine</i>, being a man of
    few words, gave a nodde: which was more than he used to everie man.
    But the preest knowing his humor, said; I am sure sir, if you knew my
    sute, you would pardon mine importunitie. I praie thee good sir <i>John</i>
    (said <i>Balbine</i>) shew me thy mind, and be breefe. That shall I doo sir
    (said he) with a good will. You know M. Doctor, through your skill in
    philosophie, that everie mans destinie is not alike; and I for my part
    am at this point, that I cannot tell whether I maie be counted happie
    or infortunate. For when I weigh mine owne case, or rather my state,
    in part I seeme fortunate, and in part miserable. But <i>Balbine</i> being
    a man of some surlinesse, alwaies willed him to draw his matter to a
    more compendious forme: which thing the preest/<span class="snp" id="p_362"><i>362.</i></span> said he would doo, and
    could the better performe; bicause <i>Balbine</i> himselfe was so learned
    and expert in the verie matter he had to repeat, and thus he began.</p>

  <p>I have had, even from my childhood, a great felicitie in the art of
    Alcumystrie, which is the verie marrow of all philosophie. <i>Balbine</i>
    at the naming of the word Alcumystrie, inclined and yeelded himselfe
    more attentivelie to hearken unto him: marie it was onelie in gesture
    of bodie; for he was spare of speech, and yet he bad him proceed
    with his tale. Then said the preest, Wretch that I am, it was not my
    lucke to light on the best waie: for you M. <i>Balbine</i> know (being so
    universallie learned)<span class="sni">Longation and curtation in Alcumystrie.</span>
    that in this art there are two waies, the one
    called longation, the other curtation; and it was mine ill hap to fall
    upon longation. When <i>Balbine</i> asked him the difference of those two
    waies; Oh sir said the preest, you might count me impudent, to take
    upon me to tell you, that of all other are best learned in this art, to
    whome I come, most humblie to beseech you to teach me that luckie waie
    of curtation. The cunninger you are, the more easilie you maie teach
    it me: and therefore hide not the gift that God hath given you, from
    your brother, who maie perish for want of his desire in this behalfe;
    and doubtlesse Jesus Christ will inrich you with greater blessings and
    endowments.</p>

  <p><i>Balbine</i> being abashed partlie with his importunitie, and partlie with
    the strange circumstance, told him that (in truth) he neither knew what
    longation or curtation meant; and therefore required him to expound
    the nature of those words. Well (quoth the preest) since it is your
    pleasure, I will doo it, though I shall thereby take upon me to teach
    him that is indeed much cunninger than my selfe. And thus he
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span> began: Oh<span class="sni">Note how the cousener circumventeth Balbine.</span>
    sir, they that have spent all the daies of their life in this divine
    facultie, doo turne one nature and forme into another, two waies, the
    one is verie breefe, but somewhat dangerous; the other much longer,
    marie verie safe, sure, and commodious. Howbeit, I thinke my selfe
    most unhappie that have spent my time and travell in that waie which
    utterlie misliketh me, and/<span class="snp"><b>256.</b></span> never could get one to shew me the other
    that I so earnestlie desire. And now I come to your worship, whom I
    know to be wholie learned and expert herein, hoping that you will (for
    charities sake) comfort your brother,/<span class="snp" id="p_363"><i>363.</i></span> whose felicitie and well doing
    now resteth onelie in your hands; and therefore I beseech you releeve
    me with your counsell.</p>

  <p>By these and such other words when this cousening varlot had avoided
    suspicion of guile, and assured <i>Balbine</i> that he was perfect and
    cunning in the other waie: <i>Balbine</i> his fingers itched, and his hart
    tickled; so as he could hold no longer, but burst out with these words:
    Let this curtation go to the divell, whose name I did never so much
    as once heare of before, and therefore doo much lesse understand it.
    But tell me in good faith, doo you exactlie understand longation? Yea
    said the preest, doubt you not hereof: but I have no fansie to that
    waie, it is so tedious. Why (quoth <i>Balbine</i>) what time is required in
    the accomplishment of this worke by waie of longation?<span class="sni">Faire
    words make fooles faine, and large offers blind the wise.</span> Too too much
    said the Alcumyster, even almost a whole yeere: but this is the best,
    the surest, and the safest waie, though it be for so manie moneths
    prolonged, before it yeeld advantage for cost and charges expended
    thereabouts. Set your hart at rest (said <i>Balbine</i>) it is no matter,
    though it were two yeeres, so as you be well assured to bring it then
    to passe.</p>

  <p>Finallie, it was there and then concluded, that presentlie the preest
    should go in hand with the worke, and the other should beare the
    charge, the gaines to be indifferentlie divided betwixt them both,
    and the worke to be doone privilie in <i>Balbins</i> house. And after the
    mutuall oth was taken for silence, which is usuall and requisite
    alwaies in the beginning of this mysterie; <i>Balbine</i> delivered monie to
    the Alcumyster for bellowes, glasses, coles, &amp;c: which should serve for
    the erection and furniture of the forge. Which monie the Alcumyster had
    no sooner fingered, but he ran merilie to the dice, to the alehouse,
    &amp; to the stewes, and who there so lustie as cousening sir <i>John</i>: who
    indeed this waie made a kind of alcumysticall transformation of monie.
    Now <i>Balbine</i> urged him to go about his businesse, but the other told
    him, that if the matter were once begun, it were halfe ended: for
    therein consisted the greatest difficultie.</p>

  <p>Well, at length he began to furnish the fornace, but now forsooth a new
    supplie of gold must be made, as the seed and spawne of that
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span> which
    must be ingendred and grow out of this worke of Alcumystrie. For even
    as a fish is not caught without a bait, no/<span class="snp" id="p_364"><i>364.</i></span> more is gold multiplied
    without some parcels of gold: and therfore gold must be the foundation
    and groundworke of that art, or else all the fat is in the fier. But
    all this while <i>Balbine</i> was occupied in calculating, and musing upon
    his accompt; casting by arythmetike, how that if one ownce yeelded
    fifteene, then how much gaines two thousand ownces might yeeld: for so
    much he determined to emploie that waie.</p>

  <p>When the Alcumyst had also consumed this monie, shewing great travell
    a moneth or twaine, in placing the bellowes, the coles, and such other
    stuffe, and no whit of profit proceeding or comming thereof: <i>Balbine</i>
    demanded how the world went, our Alcumyst was as a man amazed./<span class="snp"><b>257.</b></span>
    Howbeit he said at length; Forsooth even as such matters of importance
    commonlie doo go forward, wherunto there is alwaies verie difficult
    accesse. There was (saith he) a fault (which I have now found out) in
    the choice of the coles, which were of oke, and should have beene of
    beech. One hundreth duckets were spent that waie, so as the dising
    house and the stewes were partakers of <i>Balbines</i> charges. But after
    a new supplie of monie, better coles were provided, and matters more
    circumspectlie handled. Howbeit, when the forge had travelled long, and
    brought foorth nothing, there was another excuse found out; to wit,
    that the glasses were not tempered as they ought to have beene. But the
    more monie was disbursed hereabouts, the woorsse willing was <i>Balbine</i>
    <span class="sni">Balbine was bewitched with desire of gold, &amp;c.</span>
    to give over, according to the disers veine, whome frutelesse hope
    bringeth into a fooles paradise.</p>

  <p>The Alcumyst, to cast a good colour upon his knaverie, tooke on like
    a man moonesicke, and protested with great words full of forgerie
    and lies, that he never had such lucke before. But having found the
    error, he would be sure enough never hereafter to fall into the like
    oversight, and that henceforward all should be safe and sure, and
    throughlie recompensed in the end with large increase. Hereupon the
    workehouse is now the third time repaired, and a new supplie yet once
    againe put into the Alcumysts hand; so as the glasses were changed. And
    now at length the Alcumyst uttered another point of his art and cunning
    to <i>Balbine</i>;<span class="sni">Notable cousenage.</span> to wit, that those matters would proceed much better, if
    he sent our Ladie a few French crownes in reward: for the art/<span class="snp" id="p_365"><i>365.</i></span> being
    holie, the matter cannot prosperously proceed, without the favour of
    the saints. Which counsell exceedinglie pleased <i>Balbine</i>, who was so
    devout and religious, that no daie escaped him but he said our Ladie
    mattens.</p>

  <p>Now our Alcumyster having received the offering of monie, goeth on
    his holie pilgrimage, even to the next village, &amp; there consumeth
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
    it everie penie, among bawds and knaves. And at his returne, he told
    <i>Balbine</i><span class="sni">The Alcumyster bringeth Balbin into
    a fooles paradise.</span> that he had great hope of good lucke in his businesse; the
    holie virgine gave such favourable countenance, and such attentive
    eare unto his praiers and vowes. But after this, when there had beene
    great travell bestowed, and not a dram of gold yeelded nor levied
    from the forge; <i>Balbine</i> began to expostulate and reason somewhat
    roundlie with the cousening fellowe; who still said he never had such
    filthie lucke in all his life before, and could not devise by what
    meanes it came to passe, that things went so overthwartlie. But after
    much debating betwixt them upon the matter, at length it came into
    <i>Balbines</i> head to aske him if he had not foreslowed to heare masse, or
    to saie his houres: which if he had doone, nothing could prosper under
    his hand. Without doubt (said the cousener) you have hot the naile on
    the head. Wretch that I am! I remember once or twise being at a long
    feast, I omitted to saie mine <i>Ave Marie</i> after dinner. So so (said
    <i>Balbine</i>) no marvell then that a matter of such importance hath had
    so evill successe. The Alcumyster promised to doo penance; as to heare
    twelve masses for two that he had foreslowed; and for everie <i>Ave</i>
    overslipped, to render and repeate twelve to our Ladie.</p>

  <p>Soone after this, when all our Alcumysters monie was spent, &amp; also/<span class="snp"><b>258.</b></span>
    his shifts failed how to come by any more, he came home with this
    devise, as a man woonderfullie fraied and amazed, pitiouslie crieng
    and lamenting his misfortune. Whereat <i>Balbine</i> being astonished,
    desired to knowe the cause of his complaint. Oh (said the Alcumyster)
    <span class="sni">Here the Alcumyster uttereth a notorious point of cousening
    knaverie.</span>
    the courtiers have spied our enterprise; so as I for my part looke
    for nothing but present imprisonment. Whereat <i>Balbine</i> was abashed,
    bicause it was flat fellonie to go about that matter, without speciall
    licence. But (quoth the Alcumyster) I feare not to be put to death, I
    would it would fall out so: marrie I feare least I shall be shut up in
    some/<span class="snp" id="p_366"><i>366.</i></span> castell or towre, and there shall be forced to tug about this
    worke and broile in this businesse all the daies of my life.</p>

  <p>Now the matter being brought to consultation, <i>Balbine</i>, bicause he was
    cunning in the art of rhetorike, and not altogither ignorant in lawe,
    beat his braines in devising how the accusation might be answered, and
    the danger avoided. Alas (said the Alcumyster) you trouble your selfe
    all in vaine, for you see the crime is not to be denied, it is so
    generallie bruted in court: neither can the fact be defended, bicause
    of the manifest lawe published against it. To be short, when manie
    waies were devised, and divers excuses alledged by <i>Balbine</i>, and no
    sure ground to stand on for their securitie; at length the Alcumyster
    having present want and need of monie, framed his speech in this sort;
    Sir said he to <i>Balbine</i>, we use slowe counsell, and yet
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span> the matter
    requireth hast. <span class="sni">Marke how this Alcumyster goeth frō one degree of cousenage
    to another.</span>For I thinke they are comming for me yer this time to
    hale me awaie to prison; and I see no remedie but to die valiantlie
    in the cause. In good faith (said <i>Balbine</i>) I knowe not what to
    saie to the matter. No more do I said the Alcumyster, but that I see
    these courtiers are hungrie for monie, and so much the readier to be
    corrupted &amp; framed to silence. And though it be a hard matter, to give
    those rakehels till they be satisfied: yet I see no better counsell
    or advise at this time. No more could <i>Balbine</i>, who gave him thirtie
    ducats of gold to stop their mouthes, who in an honest cause would
    rather have given so manie teeth out of his head, than one of those
    peeces out of his pouch. This coine had the Alcumyster, who for all his
    pretenses &amp; gaie gloses was in no danger, other than for lacke of monie
    to leese his leman or concubine, whose acquaintance he would not give
    over, nor forbeare hir companie, for all the goods that he was able to
    get, were it by never such indirect dealing and unlawfull meanes.</p>

  <p>Well, yet now once againe dooth <i>Balbine</i> newlie furnish the forge, a
    praier being made before to our Ladie to blesse the enterprise. And all
    things being provided and made readie according to the Alcumysters owne
    asking, &amp; all necessaries largelie ministred after his owne liking; a
    whole yeare being likewise now consumed about this bootlesse businesse,
    and nothing brought to passe; there fell out a strange chance, and that
    by this meanes insuing, as you shall heare./</p>

  <p><span class="snp" id="p_367"><i>367.</i></span>Our Alcumyster forsooth used a little extraordinarie lewd cōpanie with
    a courtiers wife, whiles he was from home, who suspecting the matter,
    came to the doore unlooked for, and called to come in, threatning them
    that he would breake open the doores upon them. Some present devise
    (you see) was now requisite, and there was none other to be had,/<span class="snp"><b>259.</b></span>
    but such as the oportunitie offered; to wit, to leape out at a backe
    window: which he did, not without great hazard, and some hurt. But this
    was soone blazed abroad, so as it came to <i>Balbines</i> eare, who shewed
    in countenance that he had heard heereof, though he said nothing.
    <span class="sni">The miledest and softest nature is cōmonlie soonest abused.</span> But
    the Alcumyster knew him to be devout, &amp; somewhat superstitious: and
    such men are easie to be intreated to forgive, how great soever the
    fault be, and devised to open the matter in maner and forme following.</p>

  <p>O Lord (saith he before <i>Balbine</i>) how infortunatlie goeth our
    businesse forward! I marvell what should be the cause. Whereat
    <i>Balbine</i>, being one otherwise that seemed to have vowed silence, tooke
    occasion to speake, saieng; It is not hard to knowe the impediment and
    stop heereof: for it is sinne that hindereth this matter; which is
    not to be dealt in but with pure hands. Whereat the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span> Alcumyster fell
    upon his knees, beating his breast, &amp; lamentablie cried, saieng; Oh
    maister <i>Balbine</i>, you saie most trulie, it is sinne that hath doone us
    all this displeasure; not your sinne sir, but mine owne, good maister
    <i>Balbine</i>. Neither will I be ashamed to discover my filthinesse unto
    you, as unto a most holy and ghostlie father. The infirmitie of the
    flesh had overcome me, and the divell had caught me in his snare. Oh
    wretch that I am! Of a preest I am become an adulterer. Howbeit, the
    monie that erstwhile was sent to our Ladie, was not utterlie lost: for
    if she had not beene, I had certeinlie beene slaine. For the good man
    of the house brake open the doore, and the windowe was lesse than I
    could get out thereat. And in that extremitie of danger it came into
    my mind to fall downe prostrate to the virgine; beseeching hir (if our
    gift were acceptable in hir sight) that she would, in consideration
    thereof, assist me with hir helpe.<span class="sni"><i>En immensa
    cavi spirant mendacia folles.</i></span> And to be short, I ran to the

    <i>Balbine</i> did not onelie beleeve to be true, but in respect therof
    forgave him, religiouslie admonishing/<span class="snp" id="p_368"><i>368.</i></span> him to shew himselfe thankfull
    to that pitifull and blessed Ladie.</p>

  <p>Now once againe more is made a new supplie of monie, and mutuall
    promise made to handle this divine matter hence forward purelie and
    holilie. To be short, after a great number of such parts plaied by the
    Alcumyster; one of <i>Balbins</i> acquaintance espied him, that knew him
    from his childhood to be but a cousening merchant; and told <i>Balbine</i>
    what he was, and that he would handle him in the end, even as he had
    used manie others: for a knave he ever was, and so he would proove. But
    what did <i>Balbine</i>,<span class="sni">Balbine is ashamed that he should be overshot and overseene
    in a case of flat cousenage.</span> thinke you? Did he complaine of this counterfet,
    or cause him to be punished? No, but he gave him monie in his pursse,
    and sent him awaie; desiring him, of all courtesie, not to blab abroad
    how he had cousened him. And as for the knave Alcumyster, he needed
    not care who knew it, or what came of it: for he had nothing in goods
    or fame to be lost. And as for his cunning in Alcumystrie, he had as
    much as an asse. By this discourse <i>Erasmus</i> would give us to note,
    that under the golden name of Alcumystrie there lieth lurking no small
    calamitie; wherein there be such severall shifts and sutes of rare
    subtilties and deceipts, as that not onelie welthie men are thereby
    manie times impoverished, and that with the sweete allurement of this
    art, through their owne covetousnesse;/<span class="snp"><b>260.</b></span> as also by the flattering
    baits of hoped gaine: but even wise and learned men hereby are
    shamefullie overshot, partlie for want of due experience in the wiles
    and subtilties of the world, and partlie through the softenesse and
    pliablenesse of their good nature, which cousening knaves doo commonlie
    abuse to their owne lust and commoditie, and to the others utter
    undooing.</p>

    <span class="sni">The substances of things are not transmutable.</span>
    in his booke of minerals reporteth, that <i>Avicenna</i> treating
    of Alcumystrie, saith; Let the dealers in Alcumystrie understand, that
    the verie nature and kind of things cannot be changed,/<span class="snp" id="p_369"><i>369.</i></span> but rather
    made by art to resemble the same in shew and likenesse: so that they
    are not the verie things indeed, but seeme so to be in appearance: as
    castels and towers doo seeme to be built in the clouds, whereas the
    representations there shewed, are nothing else but the resemblance
    of certeine objects beelow, caused in some bright and cleere cloud,
    when the aire is void of thicknes and grossenes. A sufficient proofe
    hereof maie be the looking glasse. And we see (saith he) that yellow or
    orrenge colour laid upon red, seemeth to be gold. <i>Francis Petrarch</i>
    <span class="sni"><i>Franc. Petrarch. lib. de remed. utr. fort. 1. cap. 10.</i></span>
    treating of the same matter in forme of a dialogue, introduceth a
    disciple of his, who fansied the foresaid fond profession and practise,
    saieng; I hope for prosperous successe in Alcumystrie. <i>Petrarch</i>
    answereth him; It is a woonder from whence that hope should spring,
    sith the frute thereof did never yet fall to thy lot, nor yet at anie
    time chance to anie other; as the report commonlie goeth, that manie
    rich men, by this vanitie and madnes have beene brought to beggerie,
    whiles they have wearied themselves therewith, weakened their bodies,
    and wasted their wealth in trieng the means to make gold ingender gold.
    I hope for gold according to the workemans promise, saith the disciple.
    He that hath promised thee gold, will runne awaie with thy gold, and
    thou never the wiser, saith <i>Petrarch</i>. He promiseth mee great good,
    saith the disciple. He will first serve his owne turne, and releeve his
    private povertie, saith <i>Petrarch</i>; for Alcumysters are a beggerlie
    kind of people, who though they confesse themselves bare and needie,
    yet will they make others rich and welthie: as though others povertie
    did more molest and pitie them than their owne. These be the words of
    <i>Petrarch</i>, a man of great learning and no lesse experience; who as in
    his time he sawe the fraudulent fetches of this compassing craft: so
    hath there beene no age, since the same hath beene broched, wherein
    some few wisemen have not smelt out the evill meaning of these shifting
    merchants, and bewraied them to the world.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Goschalcus Boll. ordinis S. August. in suo præceptorio,
    fol. 244. col. b. c. d. &amp; I.</i></span>An ancient writer of a religious
    order, who lived above a thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
    yeares since, discovering the diversities of theftes, after along
    enumeration, bringeth in Alcumysters, whom he calleth <i>Falsificantes
      metallorum &amp; mineralium</i>, witches and counterfetters of metals and
    minerals; and setteth/<span class="snp"><b>261.</b></span> them as deepe
    in the/<span class="snp" id="p_370"><i>370.</i></span> degree of theeves, as anie
    of the rest, whose injurious dealings are brought to open arreignment.
    It is demanded (saith he) why the art of Alcumystrie doth never proove
    that in effect, which it pretendeth in precept and promise. The answer
    is readie; that if by art gold might be made, then were it behoovefull
    to know the maner and proceeding of nature in generation; sith art is
    said to imitate and counterfet nature. Againe, it is bicause of the
    lamenesse and unperfectnesse of philosophie, speciallie concerning
    minerals: <span class="sni">No certein ground in the art Alcumysticall.</span>
    no such manner of proceeding being set downe by consent and
    agreement of philosophers in writing, touching the true and undoubted
    effect of the same. Where upon one supposeth that gold is made of
    one kind of stuffe this waie, others of another kind of stuffe that
    waie. And therefore it is a chance if anie atteine to the artificiall
    applieng of the actives and passives of gold and silver. Moreover,
    it is certeine, that quicke silver and sulphur are the materials (as
    they terme them) of mettals, and the agent is heate, which directeth:
    howbeit it is verie hard to know the due proportion of the mixture of
    the materials; which proportion the generation of gold doth require.
    And admit that by chance they atteine to such proportion; yet can they
    not readilie resume or doo it againe in another worke, bicause of the
    hidden diversities of materials, and the uncerteintie of applieng the
    actives and passives.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Idem ibid.</i></span>The same ancient author concluding against this vaine art, saith, that
    of all christian lawmakers it is forbidden, and in no case tollerable
    in anie commonwelth: first bicause it presumeth to forge idols for
    covetousnes, which are gold and silver; whereupon saith the apostle,
    <span class="sni"><i>Avaritia idolorum cultus.</i></span>
    Covetousenesse is idolworship: secondlie, for that (as <i>Aristotle</i>
    saith) coine should be skant and rare, that it might be deere; but
    the same would waxe vile, and of small estimation, if by the art of
    Alcumystrie gold and silver might be multiplied: thirdlie, bicause
    (as experience prooveth) wisemen are thereby bewitched, couseners
    increased, princes abused, the rich impoverished, the poore beggered,
    the multitude made fooles, and yet the craft and craftesmaisters
    (oh madnes!) credited. Thus far he. Whereby in few words he
    discountenanceth that profession, not by the imaginations of his owne
    braine, but by manifold circumstances of manifest proofe. Touching the
    which practise I/<span class="snp" id="p_371"><i>371.</i></span> thinke inough hath beene spoken, and more a great
    deale than needed; sith so plaine and demonstrable a matter requireth

  <h3>The seventh Chapter.</h3>

    somewhat at large I have detected the knaverie of the art
    Alcumysticall, partlie by reasons, and partlie by examples: so that
    the thing it selfe maie no lesse appeare to the judiciall eie of
    the considerers;/<span class="snp"><b>262.</b></span> than the bones and sinewes of a bodie anatomized,
    to the corporall eie of the beholders. Now it shall not be amisse
    nor impertinent, to treate somewhat of the nature of that vaine and<span class="sni">Of vaine hope.</span>
    frutelesse hope, which induceth and draweth men forward as it were with
    chordes, not onelie to the admiration, but also to the approbation of
    the same: in such sort that some are compelled rufullie to sing (as one
    in old time did, whether in token of good or ill lucke, I doo not now
    well remember) <i>Spes &amp; fortuna valete</i>; Hope and good hap adieu.</p>

  <p>No mervell then though Alcumystrie allure men so sweetlie, and intangle
    them in snares of follie; sith the baits which it useth is the hope of
    gold, the hunger wherof is by the poet termed <i>Sacra</i>, which some doo
    English, Holie; not understanding that it is rather to be interpreted,
    *Curssed<span class="sni">* <i>J. Cal. in Comment. upon Deut. serm. 127. pa. 781. col. 1. number. 40.</i></span>
    or detestable, by the figure <i>Acyron</i>, when a word of
    an unproper signification is cast in a clause as it were a cloud:
    or by the figure <i>Antiphrasis</i>, when a word importeth a contrarie
    meaning to that which it commonlie hath. For what reason can there
    be, that the hunger of gold should be counted holie, the same having
    (as depending upon it) so manie milians of mischeefes and miseries:
    as treasons, theftes, adulteries, manslaughters, trucebreakings,
    perjuries, cousenages, and a great troope of other enormities, which
    were here too long/<span class="snp" id="p_372"><i>372.</i></span> to rehearse. And if the nature of everie action be
    determinable by the end thereof,<span class="sni">A maxime.</span> then cannot this hunger be holie, but
    rather accurssed, which pulleth after it as it were with iron chaines
    such a band of outrages and enormities, as of all their labor, charge,
    care and cost, &amp;c: they have nothing else left them in lieu of lucre,
    but onlie some few burned brickes of a ruinous fornace, a pecke or two
    of ashes, and such light stuffe, which they are forced peradventure in
    fine to sell, when beggerie hath arrested and laid his mace on their
    shoulders. As for all their gold, it is resolved <i>In primam materiam</i>,
    or rather <i>In levem quendam fumulum</i>, into a light smoke or fumigation
    of vapors, than the which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>

    which I have declared before, by reasons, examples, and
    authorities, I will now prosecute and conclude by one other example;
    to the end that we, as others in former ages, maie judge of vaine hope
    accordinglie, and be no lesse circumspect to avoid the inconveniences
    therof, than <i>Ulysses</i> was warie to escape the incantations of <i>Circes</i>
    that old transforming witch. Which example of mine is drawne from
    <i>Lewes</i> the<span class="sni"><i>Erasmus in colloq. cui titulus Convivium fabulosum.</i></span>
    French king, the eleventh of that name, who being on a
    time at <i>Burgundie</i>, fell acquainted by occasion of hunting with one
    <i>Conon</i>, a clownish but yet an honest and hartie good fellow. For
    princes and great men de/light<span class="snp"><b>263.</b></span> much in such plaine clubhutchens. The
    king oftentimes, by meanes of his game, used the countrimans house for
    his refreshing; and as noble men sometimes take pleasure in homelie
    and course things, so the king did not refuse to eate turnips and
    rape rootes in <i>Conons</i> cotage. Shortlie after king <i>Lewes</i> being at
    his pallace, void of troubles and disquietnesse, <i>Conons</i> wife/<span class="snp" id="p_373"><i>373.</i></span> wild
    him to repaire to the court, to shew himselfe to the king, to put him
    in mind of the old intertainement which he had at his house, and to
    present him with some of the fairest and choisest rape rootes that she
    had in store. <i>Conon</i> seemed loth, alledging that he should but lose
    his labour: for princes (saith he) have other matters in hand, than
    to intend to thinke of such trifeling courtesies. But <i>Conons</i> wife
    overcame him, and persuaded him in the end, choosing a certeine number
    of the best and goodliest rape rootes that she had: which when she had
    given hir husband to carrie to the court, he set forward on his journie
    a good trudging pase.<span class="sni">A hungrie bellie will not be brideled.</span>
    But <i>Conon</i> being tempted by the waie, partlie
    with desire of eating, and partlie with the toothsomnes of the meate
    which he bare, that by little and little he devoured up all the roots
    saving one, which was a verie faire and a goodlie great one indeed.
    Now when <i>Conon</i> was come to the court, it was his lucke to stand in
    such a place, as the king passing by, and spieng the man, did well
    remember him, and commanded that he should be brought in. <i>Conon</i> verie
    cheerelie followed his guide hard at the heeles, and no sooner sawe the
    king, but bluntlie comming to him, reached out
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span> his hand, and presented
    the gift to his maiestie. The king received it with more cheerefulnes
    than it was offered, and bad one of those that stood next him, to take
    it, and laie it up among those things which he esteemed most, &amp; had
    in greatest accompt. Then he had <i>Conon</i> to dine with him, and after
    dinner gave the countriman great thanks for his rape roote; who made
    no bones of the matter, but boldlie made challenge and claime to the
    kings promised courtesie. Whereupon the king commanded,<span class="sni">A princelie largesse.</span> that a thousand
    crownes should be given him in recompense for his roote.</p>

  <p>The report of this bountifulnes was spred in short space over all the
    kings houshold: in so much as one of his courtiers, in hope of the like
    or a larger reward gave the king a verie proper ginnet. Whose drift the
    king perceiving, and judging that his former liberalitie to the clowne,
    provoked the courtier to this covetous attempt, tooke the ginnet verie
    thankefullie: and calling some of his noble men about him, began to
    consult with them, what mends he might make his servant for his horsse.
    Whiles this was a dooing, the courtier conceived passing good/<span class="snp" id="p_374"><i>374.</i></span> hope
    of some princelie largesse, calculating and casting his cards in this
    maner; If his maiestie rewarded a sillie clowne so bountifullie for a
    simple rape roote, what will he doo to a jollie courtier for a gallent
    gennet? Whiles the king was debating the matter, and one said this,
    another that, and the courtier travelled all the while in vaine hope,
    at last saith the king, even upon the sudden; I have now bethought
    me what to bestowe upon him: and calling one of his nobles to him,
    whispered him in the eare, and willed him to fetch a thing, which he
    should find in his chamber wrapped up in silke. <span class="sni"><i>Sic
    ars deluditur arte.</i></span>The roote is brought
    wrapped in silke, which the/<span class="snp"><b>264.</b></span> king with his owne hands gave to the
    courtier, using these words therewithall, that he sped well, in so much
    as it was his good hap to have for his horsse a jewell that cost him
    a thousand crownes. The courtier was a glad man, and at his departing
    longed to be looking what it was, and his hart dansed for joy. In due
    time therefore he unwrapped the silke (a sort of his fellow courtiers
    flocking about him to testifie his good lucke) and having unfolded
    it, he found therein a drie and withered rape roote. Which spectacle
    though it set the standers about in a lowd laughter, yet it quailed the
    courtiers courage, and cast him into a shrewd fit of pensifenes. Thus
    was the confidence of this courtier turned to vanitie, who upon hope of
    good speed was willing to part from his horsse for had I wist.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The morall of the præmisses.</span>This storie dooth teach us into what follie and madnes vaine hope

    these deale with no inferiour causes: these fetch divels out
    of hell, and angels out of heaven; these raise up what bodies
    they list, though they were dead, buried, and rotten long
    before; and fetch soules out of heaven or hell with much more
    expedition than the pope bringeth them out of purgatorie.
    These I saie (among the simple, and where they feare no law
    nor accusation) take upon them also the raising of tempests,
    and earthquakes, and to doo as much as God himselfe can
    doo. These are no small fooles,<span class="sni"><i>J. Wierus in
    Pseudomonarchia dæmonum.</i></span> they go not to worke with
    a baggage tode, or a cat, as witches doo; but with a kind
    of majestie, and with authoritie they call up by name, and
    have at their commandement seventie and nine principall and
    princelie divels, who have under them, as their ministers, a
    great multitude of legions of pettie divels; as for example.</p>

  <p><i>Bileth</i><span class="sni"><i>Bileth.</i></span> is a great king and a terrible, riding on a pale horsse,

    deceive him. Then let the exorcist or conjuror take heed to himself,
    and to allaie his courage, let him hold a hazell bat in his hand,
    wherewithall he must reach out toward the east and south, and make a
    triangle without besides the circle; but if he hold not out his hand
    unto him, and he bid him come in, and he still refuse the bond or
    chaine of spirits; let the conjuror proceed to reading, and by and by
    he will submit himselfe, and come in, and doo whatsoever the exorcist

    the conjuror shew himselfe fearfull, or if he have not the chaine of
    spirits, certeinelie he will never feare nor regard him after. Also,

    there a boll of/<span class="snp"><b>269.</b></span> wine, and the ex/orcist<span class="snp" id="p_381"><i>381.</i></span> shall certeinlie
    knowe when he commeth out of his house, with his fellowes, and that the
    foresaid <i>Bileth</i> will be his helper, his friend, and obedient unto him
    when he commeth foorth. And when he commeth, let the exorcist receive
    him courteouslie, and glorifie him in his pride, and therfore he shall
    adore him as other kings doo, bicause he saith nothing without other
    princes. Also, if he be cited by an exorcist, alwaies a silver ring of
    the middle finger of the left hand must be held against the exorcists
    face, as they doo for <i>Amaimon</i>.<span class="sni"><i>Vide Amaimon.</i></span> And the dominion and power of so great
    a prince is not to be pretermitted; for there is none under the power
    &amp; dominion of the conjuror, but he that deteineth both men and women
    in doting love, till the exorcist hath had his pleasure. He is of the
    orders of powers, hoping to returne to the seaventh throne, which is
    not altogether credible, and he ruleth eightie five legions.</p>

  <p><i>Paimon</i><span class="sni"><i>Paimon.</i></span> is more obedient to <i>Lucifer</i> than other kings are. <i>Lucifer</i>
    is heere to be understood he that was drowned in the depth of his
    knowledge: he would needs be like God, and for his arrogancie was
    throwne out into destruction,<span class="sni">Ezech. 88.</span> of whome it is said; Everie pretious
    stone is thy covering. <i>Paimon</i> is constrained by divine vertue to
    stand before the exorcist; where he putteth on the likenesse of a man:
    he sitteth on a beast called a dromedarie, which is a swift runner,
    and weareth a glorious crowne, and hath an effeminate countenance.
    There goeth before him an host of men with trumpets and well sounding
    cymbals, and all musicall instruments. At the first he appeereth with
    a great crie and roring, as in <i>Circulo Salomonis</i>, and in the art
    is declared. And if this <i>Paimon</i> speake sometime that the conjuror
    understand him not, let him not therefore be dismaied. But when he hath
    delivered him the first obligation, to observe his desire, he must
    bid him also answer him distinctlie and plainelie to the questi/ons<span class="snp" id="p_382"><i>382.</i></span>
    he shall aske you, of all philosophie, wisedome, and science, and of
    all other secret things. And if you will knowe the disposition of the
    world, and what the earth is, or what holdeth it up in the water,
    or any other thing, or what is <i>Abyssus</i>, or where the wind is, or
    from whence it commeth, he will teach you aboundantlie. Consecrations
    also as well of sacrifices as otherwise may be reckoned.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>He giveth
    dignities and confirmations; he bindeth them that resist him in his
    owne chaines, and subjecteth them to the conjuror; he prepareth good
    familiars, and hath the understanding of all arts.<span class="sni">Cautions
    for the Exorcist or conjuror.</span> Note, that at the
    calling up of him, the exorcist must looke towards the northwest,
    bicause there is his house. When he is called up, let the exorcist
    receive him constantlie without feare, let him aske what questions
    or demands he list, and no doubt he shall obteine the same of him.
    And the exorcist must beware/<span class="snp"><b>270.</b></span> he forget not the creator, for those
    things, which have beene rehearsed before of <i>Paimon</i>, some saie he is
    of the order of dominations; others saie, of the order of cherubim.
    There follow him two hundred legions, partlie of the order of angels,
    and partlie of potestates. Note that if <i>Paimon</i> be cited alone by
    an offering or sacrifice, two kings followe him; to wit, <i>Beball</i> &amp;
    <i>Abalam</i>, &amp; other potentates: in his host are twentie five legions,
    bicause the spirits subject to them are not alwaies with them, except
    they be compelled to appeere by divine vertue.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The fall of Beliall.</span>Some saie that the king <i>Beliall</i> was created immediatlie after
    <i>Lucifer</i>, and therefore they thinke that he was father and seducer
    of them which fell being of the orders. For he fell first among
    the worthier and wiser sort, which went before <i>Michael</i> and other
    heavenlie angels, which were lacking. Although <i>Beliall</i> went before
    all them that were throwne downe to the earth, yet he went not before
    them that tarried in heaven. This <i>Beliall</i> is constrained by divine
    vertue, when he taketh sacrifices, gifts, and offerings, that he againe
    may give unto the offerers true answers. But he tarrieth not one houre
    in the truth, except he be constrained by the divine power, as is
    said. He taketh the forme of a beautifull angell, sitting in a firie
    chariot; he speaketh faire, he distributeth preferments of senatorship,
    and the favour of friends, and excellent familiars: he hath rule over
    eightie legions, partlie of the order of vertues, partlie of angels;
    he/<span class="snp" id="p_383"><i>383.</i></span> is found in the forme of an exorcist in the bonds of spirits. The
    exorcist must consider, that this <i>Beliall</i> doth in everie thing assist
    his subjects. If he will not submit himselfe, let the bond of spirits
    be read: the spirits chaine is sent for him, wherewith wise <i>Salomon</i>
    <span class="sni">Salomon gathered al the divels togither in a brasen vessell.</span>
    gathered them togither with their legions in a brasen vessell, where
    were inclosed among all the legions seventie two kings, of whome the
    cheefe was <i>Bileth</i>, the second was <i>Beliall</i>, the third <i>Asmoday</i>,
    and above a thousand thousand legions. Without doubt (I must confesse)
    I learned this of my maister <i>Salomon</i>; but he told me not why he
    gathered them together, and shut them up so: but I beleeve it was for
    the pride of this <i>Beliall</i>. Certeine nigromancers doo saie, that
    <i>Salomon</i>, being on a certeine daie seduced by the craft of a certeine
    woman, inclined himselfe to praie before the same idoll,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span> <i>Beliall</i>
    by name: which is not credible. And therefore we must rather thinke
    (as it is said) that they were gathered together in that great brasen
    vessell for pride and arrogancie, and throwne into a deepe lake or
    hole in <i>Babylon</i>. For wise <i>Salomon</i> did accomplish his workes by the
    divine power, which never forsooke him. And therefore we must thinke
    he worshipped not the image <i>Beliall</i>; for then he could not have
    constrained the spirits by divine vertue: for this <i>Beliall</i>, with
    three kings were in the lake. But the <i>Babylonians</i><span class="sni">The
    Babylonians disappointed of their hope.</span> woondering at the
    matter, supposed that they should find therein a great quantitie of
    treasure, and therefore with one consent went downe into the lake, and
    uncovered and brake the vessell, out of the which immediatlie flew
    the capteine divels, and were delivered to their former and proper
    places. But this <i>Beliall</i> entred into a certeine image, and there gave
    answer to them that offered and sacrificed unto him: as <i>Tocz.</i> in his
    sentences reporteth, and the <i>Babylonians</i> did worship and sacrifice
    thereunto./</p>

    witchmongers follie and credulitie, I thought good to insert, whereby
    the/<span class="snp"><b>312.</b></span> residue of their proceedings may be judged, or rather detected.
    For if we seriouslie behold the matter of conjuration, and the drift
    of conjurors, we shall find them, in mine opinion, more faultie than
    such as take upon them to be witches, as manifest offenders against
    the majestie of God, and his holie lawe, and as apparent violators of
    the lawes and quietnesse of this realme: although indeed they bring no
    such thing to passe, as is surmised and urged by credulous persons,
    couseners, liers, and witchmongers. For these are alwaies learned, and
    rather abusers of others, than they themselves by others abused.</p>

  <p>But let us see what appearance of truth or possibilitie is wrapped
    within these mysteries, and let us unfold the deceipt. They have made
    choice of certeine words, whereby they saie they can worke miracles,
    &amp;c. And first of all, that they call divels &amp; soules out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
    hell<span class="sni">Luk. 16. &amp;c.</span> (though we find in the scriptures manifest proofes that all passages
    are stopped concerning the egresse out of hell) so as they may go
    thither, but they shall never get out, for <i>Ab inferno nulla est
    redemptio</i>, out of hell there is no redemption. Well, when they have
    gotten them up, they shut them in a circle made with chalke, which is
    so stronglie beset and invironed with crosses and names, that they
    cannot for their lives get out;<span class="sni">An ironicall confutation.</span> which is a verie probable matter. Then
    can they bind them, and lose them at their pleasures, and make them
    that have beene liers from the beginning, to tell the truth: yea, they
    can compell them to doo anie thing. And the divels are forced to be
    obedient unto them, and yet cannot be brought to due obedience unto God
    their creator. This done (I saie) they can worke all maner of miracles
    (saving blew miracles) and this is beleeved of manie to be true:</p>

    among his apostles and disciples for the confirmation of his gospell,

    crosse and a censer with frankincense, and therewithall the place must
    be censed or perfumed, holie water must be sprinkled, and a holie
    stoale must be used, and (after diverse other ceremonies) a praier to
    God must be made, in maner and forme following:</p>

  <p>O Lord Jesus Christ, the knower of all secrets, which alwaies/<span class="snp" id="p_434"><i>434.</i></span>

    thou wouldest answer, name him, or else manifest him by some signe. Is

    is well tried (saith the glosse) he will not answer everie one. If the
    spirit make anie sound of voice, or knocking, at the naming of anie
    one, he is the cousener (the conjuror I would saie) that must have the
    charge of this conjuration or examination. And these forsooth must be
    the interrogatories, to wit: Whose soule art thou? Wherefore camest
    thou? What wouldest thou have? Wantest thou any suffrages, masses, or
    almes? How manie masses will serve thy turne, three, six, ten, twentie,
    thirtie, &amp;c? By what preest? Must he be religious or secular? Wilt thou

    hospitalles? Lepres? Or beggars? What shall be the signe of thy perfect
    deliverance? Wherefore liest thou in purgatorie? And such like. This
    must be doone in the night.</p>

    If there appeare no signe at this houre, it must be deferred untill

    and as yet in the state of satisfaction. *If<span class="sni">* For so they might be bewraied.</span>

    they reckoning manie by name, which had beene buried there; at the

    gave a signe that he was hir soule. He was further asked, whether he
    were damned or no; and if he were, for what cause, for what desert, or

    newlie sproong up: also what he meant by that noise and stirre he kept
    there; whether it were to have the bodie now buried in holie ground to
    be digged up againe, and laid in some other place. To all which points
    he answered by signes, as he was commanded, by the which he affirmed
    or denied anie thing, according as he strake the boord twise or thrise
    together. And when he had thus given them to understand, that†

    called the host and bodie of our Lord, with all the relikes of saintes,
    and carrie them to another place, and there saie their masse. The
    bishops substi/tute<span class="snp" id="p_437"><i>437.</i></span> judge (whome they called Officiall) understanding
    that matter, commeth thither, accompanied with certeine honest men, to
    the intent he might knowe the whole circumstance more exactlie: and
    therefore he commandeth them to make conjuration in his presence; and
    also he requireth certeine to be chosen to go up into the top of the
    vawt, and there to see whether any ghost appeered or not. <i>Stephanus
    Aterbatensis</i><span class="sni">For so might the confederate be found.</span>
    stiffelie denied that to be lawfull, and marvellouslie
    persuading the contrarie, affirmed that the spirit in no wise ought to
    be troubled. And albeit the Official urged them verie much, that there
    might be some conjuring of the spirit; yet could he nothing prevaile.</p>

  <p>Whilest these things were dooing, the Maior, when he had shewed the
    other Justices of the citie, what he would have them to doo, tooke
    his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
    journie to the king, and opened the whole matter unto him. And
    bicause the moonks refused judgement upon plea of their owne lawes and
    liberties, the king choosing out certeine of the aldermen of <i>Paris</i>,
    giveth them absolute and full authoritie to make inquirie of the
    matter. The like dooth the Chancelor maister <i>Anthonius Pratensis</i>
    cardinall and legat for the pope throughout <i>France</i>. Therefore, when
    they had no exception to alledge, they were conveied unto <i>Paris</i>, and
    there constrained to make their answer.<span class="sni">An obstinate and wilfull persisting in the denieng or not
    confessing of a fault committed.</span> But yet could nothing be wroong
    out of them by confession, whereupon they were put apart into divers
    prisons: the novice being kept in the house of maister <i>Fumanus</i>, one
    of the aldermen, was oftentimes examined, and earnestlie requested to
    utter the truth, but would notwithstanding confesse nothing; bicause he
    feared that the moonks would afterwards put him to death for staining
    their order, and putting it to open shame. But when the judges had made
    him sure promise that he should escape punishment, and that he should
    never come into their handling, he opened unto them the whole matter as
    it was doone: and being brought before his fellowes, avouched the same
    to their faces. The moonks, albeit they were convicted, and by these
    meanes almost taken tarde*<span class="sni">[* = tarred]</span> with the deed doing; yet did they refuse
    the judges, bragging and vaunting themselves on their priviledges, but
    all in vaine. For sentence passed upon them, and they were/<span class="snp"><b>317.</b></span> condemned
    to be carried backe againe to <i>Orleance</i>, and there to be cast in

    church of the citie openlie, and from thence to the place of execution,
    where they should make open confession of their trespasses.</p>

  <p>Surelie this was most common among moonks and friers, who mainteined
    their religion, their lust, their liberties, their pompe, their wealth,
    their estimation and knaverie by such cousening practises. Now I<span class="sni">A

    girdle or the garment, but the person of the bewitched) hath power to

    through the grace of the sacrament. Naie, there are examples set downe,
    where some being bewitched were cured (as <i>M. Mal.</i> taketh it) without
    any conjuration at all. Marrie there were certeine <i>Pater nosters</i>,
    <i>Aves</i>, and <i>Credos</i>/<span class="snp" id="p_439"><i>439.</i></span> said, and crosses made, but they are charmes,
    they saie, and no conjurations. For they saie that such charmes are
    lawfull, bicause there is no superstition in them, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>And it is woorth my labour, to shew you how papists define
    superstition, and how they expound the definition thereof.<span class="sni"><i>Et
    glos. super illo ad coll. 2.</i></span> Superstition
    (saie they) is a religion observed beyond measure, a religion practised
    with evill and unperfect circumstances. Also, whatsoever usurpeth

    and such like, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Mendaces debent esse memores, multò magis astuti
    exorcistæ.</i></span>These popish exorcists doo manie times forget their owne rules. For
    they should not directlie in their conjurations call upon the divell
    (as they doo) with intreatie, but with authoritie and commandement.
    Nei/ther<span class="snp"><b>318.</b></span> should they have in their charmes and conjurations anie
    unknowne names. Neither should there be (as alwaies there is) anie
    falshood conteined in the matter of the charme of conjuration, as (saie
    they) old women have in theirs, when they saie; The blessed virgine
    passed over <i>Jordan</i>, and then S. <i>Steven</i> met hir, and asked hir, &amp;c.
    Neither should they have anie other vaine characters, but the crosse
    (for those are the words:) and manie other
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>such cautions have they,
    which they observe not, for they have made it lawfull elsewhere.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Tho. Aquin. super. Marc. ultim.</i></span>But <i>Thomas</i> their cheefe piller prooveth their conjuring and charmes
    lawfull by S. <i>Marke</i>, who saith; <i>Signa eos qui crediderunt</i>; And, <i>In
      nomine meo dæmonia ejicient, &amp;c</i>:<span class="sni">Mark, 16, 17</span> whereby he also prooveth that they
    maie conjure serpents. And there he taketh paines to proove, that the
    words of God are of as great holinesse as relikes of saints, whereas
    (in such respect as they meane) they are both alike, and indeed nothing
    woorth. And I can tell them further, that so they maie be carried, as
    either of them maie doo a man much harme either in bodie or soule.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">A trimme consequent</span>But they proove this by <i>S. Augustine</i>, saieng; <i>Non est minus verbum
    Dei, quàm corpus Christi</i>: whereupon they conclude thus; By all mens

    saints; <i>Ergo</i> it is lawfull against evill spirits, to in/vocate<span class="snp" id="p_440"><i>440.</i></span>
    the name of God everie waie; by the <i>Pater noster</i>, the <i>Ave</i>, the
    nativitie, the passion, the five wounds, the title triumphant, by the
    seven words spoken on the crosse, by the nailes, &amp;c: and there maie
    be hope reposed in them.<span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef. par. 2. quæ. 2.</i></span> Yea, they saie it is lawfull to conjure all
    things, bicause the divell maie have power in all things. And first,
    alwaies the person or thing, wherein the divell is, must be exorcised,
    and then the divell must be conjured. Also they affirme, that it is as
    expedient to consecrate and conjure porrage and meate, as water and
    salt, or such like things.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Rites, ceremonies, and relikes of exorcisme in rebaptising
    of the possessed or bewitched.</span>The right order of exorcisme in rebaptisme of a person possessed or
    bewitched, requireth that exsufflation and abrenunciation be doone
    toward the west. Item, there must be erection of hands, confession,
    profession, oration, benediction, imposition of hands, denudation and
    unction, with holie oile after baptisme, communion, and induition of
    the surplis. But they saie that this needeth not, where the bewitched
    is exorcised: but that the bewitched be first confessed, and then to
    hold a candle in his hand, and in steed of a surplise to tie about his
    bare bodie a holie candle of the length of Christ, or of the crosse
    whereupon he died, which for monie maie be had at <i>Rome</i>. <i>Ergo</i> (saith
    <i>M. Mal.</i>) this maie be said; I conjure thee <i>Peter</i> or <i>Barbara</i> being
    sicke, but regenerate in the holie water of baptisme, by the living
    God, by the true God, by the holie God, by the God which redeemed thee
    with his pretious bloud, that thou maiest be made a conjured man, that
    everie fantasie and wickednesse of diabolicall deceipt doo avoid and
    depart from thee, and that everie uncleane spirit be conjured through
    him that shall come to judge the quicke and the dead, and the world
    by fier, Amen: <i>Oremus</i>, &amp;c. And this conjuration, with <i>Oremus</i>, and
    a praier, must be thrise repeated, and at the end alwaies
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span> must be
    said; <i>Ergo maledicte diabole recognosce sententiam tuam, &amp;c.</i> And
    this order must alwaies be/<span class="snp"><b>319.</b></span> followed. And finallie, there must be
    diligent search made,<span class="sni">Memorandum that this is for one bewitched.</span> in everie corner, and under everie coverlet and
    pallet, and under everie threshhold of the doores, for instruments of
    witchcraft. And if anie be found, they must streight-waie be throwne
    into the fier. Also they must change all their bedding, their clothing,
    and their habitation. And if nothing be found, the partie that is to
    be exorcised or conjured, must come to the church rath in the morning:
    and the holier the daie is, the/<span class="snp" id="p_441"><i>441.</i></span> better, speciallie our Ladie daie.
    And the preest, if he be shriven himselfe and in perfect state, shall
    doo the better therein. And let him that is exorcised hold a holie
    candle in his hand, &amp;c.<span class="sni">Note the proviso.</span> Alwaies provided, that the holie water be
    throwne upon him, and a stoale put about his necke, with <i>Deus in
    adjutorium</i>, and the Letanie, with invocation of saints. And this order
    maie continue thrise a weeke, so as (saie they) through multiplication
    of intercessors, or rather intercessions, grace maie be obteined, and
    favor procured.</p>

  <p>There is also some question in the Romish church, whether the sacrament
    of the altar is to be received before or after the exorcisme. Item
    in shrift, the confessor must learne whether the partie be not
    excommunicate, and so for want of absolution, endure this vexation.
    <i>Thomas</i><span class="sni"><i>Tho. Aquin. supr. dist. 6.</i></span> sheweth the difference betwixt holie water and conjuration,
    saieng that holie water driveth the divell awaie from the externall and
    outward parts; but conjurations from the internall and inward parts;
    and therefore unto the bewitched partie both are to be applied.</p>

    reason why some are not remedied for all their conjurations,
    <span class="sni">1<br />2<br />3<br />4<br />5<br />6, 7</span> the
    papists say is for seven causes. First, for that the faith of the

    partie is no better; thirdlie, bicause of the sinnes of the bewitched;
    fourthlie, for the neglecting of meete remedies; fiftlie, for the
    reverence of vertues going out into others; sixtlie, for the purgation;
    seventhlie, for the merit of the partie bewitched. And lo, the first
    foure are proved by <i>Matthew</i> the 7. and <i>Marke</i> the 4./<span class="snp" id="p_442"><i>442.</i></span> when one
    presented his sonne, and the multitude
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span> wanted faith, &amp; the father
    said, Lord help mine incredulitie or unbeleefe.<span class="sni">Proper
    proofes of the former seven reasons.</span> Wherupon was said, Oh
    faithlesse and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? And
    where these words are written; And Jesus rebuked him, &amp;c. That is to
    saie, saie they, the possessed or bewitched for his sinnes. For by the
    neglect of due remedies it appeereth, that there were not with Christ
    good and perfect men: for the pillers of the faith; to wit, <i>Peter</i>,
    <i>James</i>, and <i>John</i> were absent. Neither was there fasting and praier,
    without the which that kind of divels could not be cast out. For the
    fourth point; to wit, the fault of the exorcist in faith maie ap/peare;<span class="snp"><b>320.</b></span>
    for that afterwards the disciples asked the cause of their impotencie
    therin. And Jesus answered, it was for their incredulitie; saieng that
    if they had as much faith as a graine of mustard seed, they should
    move mountaines, &amp;c. The fift is prooved by <i>Vitas patrum</i>, the lives
    of the fathers, where it appeereth that S. <i>Anthonie</i> could not doo
    that cure, when his scholar <i>Paule</i> could doo it, and did it. For the
    proofe of the sixt excuse it is said, that though the fault be taken
    awaie therby; yet it followeth not that alwaies the punishment is
    released. Last of all it is said, that it is possible that the divell
    was not conjured out of the partie before baptisme by the exorcist,
    or the midwife hath not baptised him well, but omitted some part of
    the sacrament.<span class="sni">Why there were no conjurors in y<sup>e</sup> primitive church with
    other subtill points.</span> If any object that there were no exorcists in the
    primitive church, it is answered, that the church cannot now erre. And
    saint <i>Gregorie</i> would never have instituted it in vaine. And it is
    a generall rule, that who or whatsoever is newlie exorcised, must be
    rebaptised: as also such as walke or talke in their sleepe; for (saie
    they) call them by their names, and presentlie they wake, or fall if
    they clime: whereby it is gathered, that they are not trulie named in
    baptisme. Item they saie, it is somewhat more difficult to conjure the
    divell out of one bewitched, than out of one possessed: bicause in the
    bewitched, he is double; in the other single. They have a hundred such
    beggerlie, foolish, and frivolous notes in this behalfe.</p>

    will doo any thing for them. For if anie that meaneth good faith with
    the divell read certeine conjurations, he commeth up (they saie) at a
    trice. Marrie if another that hath none intent to raise him, read or
    pronounce the words, he will not stirre. And yet <i>J. Bodin</i><span class="sni">A

    with none other, than witches and conjurors. I for my part have read
    a number of their conjurations, but never could see anie divels of
    theirs, except it were in a plaie. But the divell (belike) knoweth my
    mind; to wit, that I would be loth to come within the compasse of his

    HE papists<span class="sni">Papists and conjurors cousening compeers.</span>
    you see, have their certeine generall rules and lawes, as
    to absteine from sinne, and to fast, as also otherwise to be cleane
    from all pollusions, &amp;c: and even so likewise have the other conjurors.
    Some will saie that papists use divine service, and praiers; even so
    doo common conjurors (as you see) even in the same papisticall forme,
    no whit swarving from theirs in faith and doctrine, nor yet in ungodlie
    and unreasonable kinds of petitions. Me thinks it may be a sufficient
    argument, to overthrow the calling up and miraculous works of spirits,
    that it is written;<span class="sni">1. Sam. 16, 7.<br />1. Reg. 8,&nbsp; 39.<br />
    Jere.&nbsp; 17, 10.<br />Psal.&nbsp; 44, 21.<br />Psal.&nbsp; 72, 18.</span> God onelie knoweth and searcheth the harts, and
    onelie worketh great woonders. The which argument being prosecuted
    to the end, can never be answered: insomuch as that divine power is
    required in that action.</p>

  <p>And if it be said, that in this conjuration we speake to the spirits,
    and they heare us, &amp; therefore need not know our thoughts and
    imaginations: I first aske them whether king <i>Baell</i>, or <i>Amoimon</i>,
    which are spirits reigning in the furthest regions of the east (as they
    saie) may heare a conjurors voice, which calleth for them, being in the
    extreamest parts of the west, there being such noises interposed, where
    perhaps also they may be busie, and set to worke on the like affaires.
    Secondlie, whether those spirits be of the same power that God is, who
    is everiewhere, filling all places, and able to heare all men at one
    instant, &amp;c. Thirdlie, whence commeth the force of such words as raise
    the dead, and command divels. If sound doo it, then may it be doone by
    a taber and a pipe, or any other instrument that hath no life. If the
    voice doo it, then may it be doone by any beasts or birds. If words,
    then a parret may doo it. If in mans words onlie, where is the/<span class="snp" id="p_448"><i>448.</i></span> force,
    in the first, second, or third syllable? If in syllables, then not in
    words. If in imaginations, then the divell knoweth our thoughts. But
    all this stuffe is vaine and fabulous.</p>

  <p>It is written;<span class="sni">Sap. 1. 14.<br />Ecclesi. 9.<br />Gen. 1.</span>
    All the generations of the earth were healthfull, and
    there is no poison of destruction in them. Why then doo they conjure
    holsome creatures; as salt, water, &amp;c: where no divels are? God looked
    upon all his works, and sawe they were all good.<span class="sni">Act. 19.</span> What effect (I praie
    you) had the 7. sonnes of <i>Sceva</i>; which is the great
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span> objection of
    witchmongers? They would needs take upon them to conjure divels out
    of the possessed. But what brought they to passe? Yet that was in the
    time, whilest God suffered miracles commonlie to be wrought. By that
    you may see what conjurors can doo.</p>

  <p>Where is such a promise to conjurors or witches, as is made in the
    Gospell to the faithfull?<span class="sni">Mark 16. 17.</span> where it is written; In my name they shall
    cast/<span class="snp"><b>324.</b></span> out divels, speake with new toongs: if they shall drinke any
    deadlie thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall take awaie serpents,
    they shall laie hands on the sicke, and they shall recover. According
    to the promise, this grant of miraculous working was performed in the
    primitive church, for the confirmation of Christs doctrine, and the
    establishing of the Gospell.</p>

  <p>But as in another place I have prooved, the gift thereof was but for
    a time, and is now ceased; neither was it ever made to papist, witch,
    or conjuror. They take upon them to call up and cast out divels; and
    to undoo with one divell, that which another divell hath doone. If one
    divell could cast out another, it were a kingdome divided, and could
    not stand. Which argument Christ himselfe maketh: and therfore I maie
    the more boldlie saie even with Christ, that they have no such power.
    For <sup>a</sup>besides<span class="sni"><sup>a</sup> Isai. 43. 11.</span> him, there is no saviour,
    <sup>b</sup>none<span class="sni"><sup>b</sup> verse. 13.<br />cap. 44.<br />verse.

    Luke. 11. 20.<br />Matt. 12. 28.<br />Acts, 8.&nbsp; 19.</span>There is no helpe in inchanters and soothsaiers, and other such vaine
    sciences. For divels are cast out by the finger of God, which <i>Matthew</i>
    calleth the spirit of God, which is the mightie power of God, and not
    by the vertue of the bare name onelie, being spoken or pronounced: for
    then might everie wicked man/<span class="snp" id="p_449"><i>449.</i></span> doo it. And <i>Simon Magus</i> needed not then
    to have proffered monie to have bought the power to doo miracles and
    woonders: for he could speake and pronounce the name of God, as well as
    the apostles. Indeed they maie soone throwe out all the divels that are
    in frankincense, and such like creatures, wherein no divels are: but
    neither they, nor all their holie water can indeed cure a man possessed
    with a divell, either in bodie or mind; as Christ did. Naie, why doo
    they not cast out the divell that possesseth their owne soules?</p>

  <p>Let me heare anie of them all speake with new toongs, let them drinke
    but one dramme of a potion which I will prepare for them, let them cure
    the sicke by laieng on of hands (though witches take it upon them,
    and witchmongers beleeve it) and then I will subscribe unto them. But
    if they, which repose such certeintie in the actions of witches and
    conjurors, would diligentlie note their deceipt, and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>how the scope
    whereat they shoote is monie<span class="sni">Monie is the marke whereat al witches &amp; conjurors doo aime.</span> (I meane not such witches as are falselie
    accused, but such as take upon them to give answers, &amp;c: as mother
    <i>Bungie</i> did) they should apparentlie see the cousenage. For they are
    abused, as are manie beholders of jugglers, which suppose they doo
    miraculouslie, that which is doone by slight and subtiltie.</p>

  <p>But in this matter of witchcrafts and conjurations, if men would rather
    trust their owne eies, than old wives tales and lies, I dare undertake
    this matter would soone be at a perfect point; as being easier to be
    perceived than juggling. But I must needs confesse, that it is no
    great marvell, though the simple be abused therein, when such lies
    concerning those matters are mainteined by such persons of account,
    and thrust into their divine service. As for example:/<span class="snp"><b>325.</b></span> It is written
    that S. <i>Martine</i> thrust his fingers into ones mouth that had a divell
    within him, and used to bite folke; and then did bid him devoure them
    if he could. And bicause the divell could not get out at his mouth,
    being stopt with S. <i>Martins</i><span class="sni">S. Martins cōjuration:

    ND still me thinks papists (of all others) which indeed are most

    in the words of consecration or conjuration (for so*<span class="sni">* To wit,
    <i>Vincent. dominica in albis: in octa. pasch. sermone. 15.<br />Durand. de exorcist.</i></span> their owne
    doctors terme them) they adjure the water, &amp;c: to heale, not onelie

    the candles last one minute the longer: with what face can they defend
    the others miraculous workes; as though the witches and conjurors

    their cousenage and knaverie well enough, who saith;
    They which boast so, that they can remoove or helpe the infections of

    or meanes, are but needie fellowes, wanting living; and therefore
    referre their words to the divell: bicause they would seeme to know
    somewhat more than the common people. It is marvell that papists doo
    affirme, that their holie water, crosses, or bugges words have such
    vertue and violence, as to drive awaie divels: so as they dare not
    approch to anie place or person besmeered with such stuffe; when as it

    and all other things necessarie for a magician;<span class="sni">Tiridates the great magician biddeth the emperor Nero to a

    invited <i>Nero</i><span class="snp" id="p_453"><i>453.</i></span> to certeine magicall bankets and exercises. Which when
    <i>Nero</i> required to learne,/ he (to hide his cousenage) answered that he
    would not, nor could not teach him, though he would have given him his
    kingdome. The matter of his refusall (I saie) was, least <i>Nero</i> should
    espie the cousening devises thereof. Which when <i>Nero</i> conceived, and

    strong lawes against the use and the practisers thereof: as <i>Plinie</i>

    abused, as to suppose that sathan may be commanded, compelled, or tied
    by the power of man: as though the divell would yeeld to man, beyond
    nature; that will not yeeld to God his creator, according to the rules
    of nature. And in so much as there be (as they confesse) good angels
    as well as bad; I would know whie they call up the angels of hell, and
    not call downe the angels of heaven. But this they answer (as <i>Agrippa</i>

    and was not onelie a great conjuror and practiser thereof, but also
    wrote cunninglie <i>De occulta philosophia</i>. Howbeit, afterwards in his
    wiser age, he recanteth his opinions, and lamenteth his follies in
    that behalfe, and discovereth the impietie and vanities of magicians,
    and inchanters, which boast they can doo miracles: which action is
    now ceased (saith he) and assigneth them a place with <i>Jannes</i> and
    <i>Jambres</i>, affirming that this art teacheth nothing but vaine toies
    for a shew. <i>Carolus Gallus</i> also saith; I have tried oftentimes, by
    the witches and conjurors themselves, that their arts (especiallie
    those which doo consist of charmes, impossibilities,/<span class="snp"><b>328.</b></span> conjurations, and

    T is affirmed by sundrie authors, that <i>Salomon</i> was the first
    inventor of those conjurations; and thereof <i>Josephus</i> is the first
    reporter, who in his fift booke <i>De Judæorum antiquitatibus</i>, cap. 22.
    rehearseth soberlie this storie following; which <i>Polydore Virgil</i>,

    fable, whereof there is skant a true word.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span></p>

  <p><i>Salomon</i> was the greatest philosopher, and did philosophie about all
    things, and had the full and perfect knowlege of all their proprieties:
    but he had that gift given from above to him, for the profit and
    health of mankind: which is effectuall against divels. He made also
    inchantments, wherewith diseases are driven awaie; and left diverse
    maners of conjurations written, whereunto the divels giving place are
    so driven awaie, that they never returne. And this kind of healing is
    very common among my countrimen: for I sawe a neighbour of mine, one
    <i>Eleazer</i>, that in the presence of <i>Vespasian</i><span class="sni"><i>Probatum
    est</i> upon a patient before witnes: <i>Ergo</i> no lie.</span> and his sonnes, and the
    rest of the souldiers, cured many that were possessed with spirits. The
    maner and order of his cure was this. He did put unto the nose of the
    possessed a ring, under the seale wherof was inclosed a kind of roote,
    whose verture <i>Salomon</i> declared, and the savour thereof drewe the
    divell out at his nose; so as downe fell the man, and then <i>Eleazer</i>
    conjured the divell to depart, &amp; to return no more to him. In the meane
    time he made mention of <i>Salomon</i>, reciting incantations of <i>Salomons</i>
    owne making. And then <i>Eleazer</i> being willing to shew the standers by
    his cunning, and the wonderfull efficacie of his art, did set not farre
    from thence, a pot or basen full of water, &amp; commanded the divell that
    went out of the man, that by the overthrowing thereof, he would give
    a signe to the beholders, that he had utterlie forsaken and leaft the
    man./<span class="snp" id="p_455"><i>455.</i></span> Which thing being doone, none there doubted how great <i>Salomons</i>
    knowledge and wisedome was. Wherin a jugling knacke was produced, to

  <p>Another storie of <i>Salomons</i> conjuration I find cited in the sixt
    lesson, read in the church of <i>Rome</i> upon S. <i>Margarets</i> daie, far more
    ridiculous than this. Also <i>Peter Lombard</i> maister of the sentences,
    and <i>Gratian</i><span class="sni"><i>Lib. 4 dist. 14.</i> <i>Decret. aureum. dist. 21</i> <i>Rub. de
    exorcist.</i></span> his brother, the compiler of the golden decrees; and
    <i>Durandus</i> in his <i>Rationale divinorum</i>, doo all soberlie affirme
    <i>Salomons</i> cunning in this behalfe; and speciallie this tale; to wit,
    that <i>Salomon</i> inclosed certeine thousand di/vels<span class="snp"><b>329.</b></span> in a brasen bowle,
    and left it in a deepe hole or lake, so as afterwards the <i>Babylonians</i>
    found it, and supposing there had beene gold or silver therein, brake
    it, and out flew all the divels, &amp;c. And that this fable is of credit,
    you shall perceive, in that it is thought woorthie to be read in the
    Romish church as parcell of their divine service. Looke in the lessons
    of S. <i>Margarets</i><span class="sni"><i>Lect. 5. &amp; 6.</i></span> daie the virgine, and you shall find these words
    verbatim: which I the rather recite, bicause it serveth me for divers
    turnes; to wit, for <i>Salomons</i> conjurations, for the tale of the brasen
    vessell, and for the popes conjurations, which extended both to faith
    and doctrine, and to shew of what credit their religion is, that so
    shamefullie is stained with lies and fables.</p>

    HERE was (after a sermon made, wherein this storie of S. <i>Margaret</i>
    was recited, for in such stuffe consisted not onelie their service, but
    also their sermons in the blind time of poperie:) there was (I saie)
    a certeine yoong man, being a <i>Lombard</i>, whose simplicitie was such,
    as he had no respect unto the commoditie of worldlie things, but did
    altogither affect the salvation of his soule, who hearing how great S.
    <i>Margarets</i><span class="sni"><i>Kakozelia.</i></span> triumph was, began to consider with himselfe, how full of
    slights the divell was. And among other things thus he said; Oh that
    God would suffer, that the divell might fight with me hand to hand
    in visible forme! I would then surelie in like maner overthrow him,
    and would fight with him till I had the victorie. And therefore about
    the twelfe houre he went out of the towne, and finding a convenient
    place where to praie, secretlie kneeling on his knees, he praied among
    other things, that God would suffer the divell to appeare unto him
    in visible forme, that according to the example of S. <i>Margaret</i>, he
    might overcome him in battell. And as he was in the middest of his
    praiers, there came into that place a woman with a hooke in hir hand,
    to gather certeine hearbs which grew there, who was dumme borne.<span class="sni">Mutuall
    error by meanes of sudden sight.</span> And
    when she came into the place, and saw the yoong man among the hearbs
    on his knees, she was afraid, and waxed pale, and going backe, she
    rored in such sort, as hir voice could not be understood, and with hir
    head and fists made threatning signes unto him. The yoong man seeing
    such an ilfavoured fowle queane, that was for age decrepit and full of
    wrinkles, with a long bodie, leane of face, pale of colour, with ragged
    cloathes, crieng verie lowd, and having a voice not understandable,
    threatning him with the hooke which she carried in hir hand, he thought
    surelie she had beene no woman, but a divell appea/ring<span class="snp" id="p_458"><i>458.</i></span> unto him in the
    shape of a woman, and thought God had heard his praiers. For the which
    causes he fell upon hir lustilie, and at length threw hir downe to the
    ground, saieng; Art thou come thou curssed divell, art thou come? No
    no, thou shalt not overthrow me in visible fight, whome thou hast often
    overcome in invisible temptation.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span></p>

  <p>And as he spake these words, he caught hir by the haire, and drew hir
    about, beating hir sometimes with his hands, sometimes with his heeles,
    and sometimes with the hooke so long, and wounded hir so sore, that
    he/<span class="snp"><b>331.</b></span> left hir a dieng. At the noise whereof manie people came running
    unto them, and seeing what was doone, they apprehended the yoong man,
    and thrust him into a vile prison. S. <i>Vincent</i><span class="sni">S. Vincent raiseth the dead woman to life.</span> by vertue of his
    holines understanding all this matter, caused the bodie that seemed
    dead to be brought unto him, and thereupon (according to his maner)
    he laid his hand upon hir, who immediatlie revived, and he called one
    of his chaplines to heare hir confession. But they that were present
    said to the man of God, that it were altogether in vaine so to doo,
    for that she had beene from hir nativitie dumbe, and could neither
    heare nor understand the priest, neither could in words confesse
    hir sinnes. Notwithstanding, S. <i>Vincent</i><span class="sni">S. Vincent maketh the dumbe to speake.</span> bad the priest heare hir

    things unto him. And therfore, whatsoever the man of God commanded,
    the priest did confidentlie accomplish and obeie: and as soone as the
    priest approched unto hir, to heare hir confession, she, whome all
    <i>Cathalonia</i> knew to be dumbe borne, spake, and confessed hir selfe,
    pronouncing everie word as distinctlie, as though she had never beene
    dumbe. After hir confession she required the eucharist and extreame
    unction to be ministred unto hir, and at length she commended hir selfe
    to God; and in the presence of all that came to see that miracle, she
    spake as long as she had anie breath in hir bodie. The yoong man that
    killed hir being saved from the gallowes by S. <i>Vincents</i> meanes,

    verie cleare, that could see a little dove sitting upon a crosse so

    it among the papists, that all soules walked on the earth, after they
    departed from their bodies? In so much as it was in the time of poperie
    a usuall matter, to desire sicke people in their death beds, to appeare
    to them after their death, and to reveale their estate. The fathers
    and ancient doctors of the church were too credulous herein, &amp;c.
    Therefore no mervell, though the common simple sort of men, and least
    of all, that women be deceived herein. God in times past did send downe
    visible angels and appearances to men; but now he dooth not so. Through
    ignorance of late in religion, it was thought, that everie
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span> churchyard
    swarmed with soules and spirits: but now the word of God being more
    free, open, and knowne, those conceipts and illusions are made more
    manifest and apparent, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The doctors, councels, and popes, which (they saie) cannot erre, have
    confirmed the walking, appearing, &amp; raising of soules./<span class="snp" id="p_463"><i>463.</i></span> But where
    find they in the scriptures anie such doctrine? And who certified
    them, that those appearances were true? Trulie all they cannot bring
    to passe, that the lies which have beene spread abroad herein, should
    now beginne to be true, though the pope himselfe subscribe, seale, and
    sweare thereunto never so much. Where are the soules that swarmed in
    times past? Where are the spirits? Who heareth their noises? Who seeth
    their visions? Where are the soules that made such mone for trentals,
    whereby to be eased of the paines in purgatorie? Are they all gone
    into <i>Italie</i>, bicause masses are growne deere here in <i>England</i>?
    Marke well this illusion, and see how contrarie it is unto the word of

    and <i>Abdias</i> his sonne, with his freend S. <i>Steven</i>, appeared to a
    certeine preest, called Sir <i>Lucian</i>, requesting him to remove their
    bodies, and to burie them in some better place (for they had lien
    from the time of their death, untill then, being in the reigne of
    <i>Honorius</i> the emperor; to wit, foure hundred yeeres buried in the
    field of <i>Gamaliel</i>, who in that respect said to Sir <i>Lucian</i>; <i>Non

    in your eares. I could recite a great number of tales, how men have
    even forsaken their houses, bicause of such apparitions and noises: and
    all hath beene by meere and ranke knaverie. And wheresoever you shall
    heare, that there is in the night season such rumbling and fearefull
    noises, be you well assured that it is flat knaverie, performed by some
    that seemeth most to complaine, and is least mistrusted. And hereof
    there is a verie art, which for some respects I will not discover.
    The divell seeketh dailie as well as nightlie whome he may devoure,
    and can doo his feats as well by daie as by night, or else he is a
    yoong divell, and a verie bungler. But of all other couseners, these
    conjurors are in the highest degree, and are most worthie of death
    for their blasphemous impietie. But that these popish visions and
    conjurations used as well by papists, as by the popes themselves, were
    meere cousenages; and that the tales of the popes recited by <i>Bruno</i>
    and <i>Platina</i>, of their magicall devises, were but plaine cousenages
    and knaveries, may appeare by the historie of <i>Bonifacius</i> the eight,
    who used this kind of inchantment, to get away the popedome from his
    predecessor <i>Cœlestinus</i>. He counterfetted a voice through a cane reed,
    as though it had come from heaven, persuading him to yeeld up his
    authoritie of popeship, and to institute therein one <i>Bonifacius</i>,<span class="sni">Pope <i>Cœlestinus</i> cousened of his popedome by pope
    <i>Boniface</i>.</span> a
    worthier man: otherwise he threatened him with damnation. And therfore
    the foole yeelded it up accordinglie, to the said <i>Bonifacius</i>, <i>An.</i>
    1264. of whom it was said; He came in like a fox, lived like a woolfe,
    and died like a dog./</p>

  <p><span class="snp" id="p_465"><i>465.</i></span>There be innumerable examples of such visions, which when they are
    not detected, go for true stories: and therefore when it is answered
    that some are true tales and some are false, untill they be
    able to shew foorth before your eies one matter of truth, you
    may replie upon them with this distinction;
    to wit: <span class="sni">Visions distinguished</span>visions tried are false
    visions, undecided and

    LAS! how manie naturall things are there so strange, as to manie seeme
    miraculous; and how manie counterfet matters are there, that to the
    simple seeme yet more wonderfull? <i>Cardane</i><span class="sni"><i>H. Card. lib. de subtilitat. 18.</i></span> telleth of one <i>Comensis</i>,
    who comming late to a rivers side, not knowing where to passe over,
    cried out alowd for some bodie to shew him the foord: who hearing an
    eccho to answer according to his last word, supposing it to be a man
    that answered him and informed him of the waie, he passed through the
    river, even there where was a deepe whirlepoole, so as he hardlie
    escaped with his life; and told his freends, that the divell had almost
    persuaded him to drowne himselfe. And in some places these noises of
    eccho are farre more strange than other, speciallie at <i>Ticinum</i> in
    <i>Italie</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Idem, ibid.</i></span> in the great hall, where it rendereth sundrie and manifold
    noises or voices, which seeme to end so lamentablie, as it were a man

    a spirit that answereth.</p>

  <p>The noise at <i>Winchester</i><span class="sni">Of Winchester noise.</span> was said to be a verie miracle, and much
    wondering was there at it, about the yeare 1569. though indeed a meere

    and other instrumentall matters helping the sound to seeme strange

    HERE is yet another art professed by these cousening conjurors,

    necromancie, which is called Theurgie; wherein they worke by good
    angels. Howbeit, their ceremonies are altogether papisticall and
    superstitious, consisting in cleanlines partlie of the mind, partlie

    oblations and sacrifices; the cleanlines whereof,
    they saie, dooth dispose men to the contemplation of heavenlie things.
    They cite these words of <i>Esaie</i> for their authoritie; to wit: Wash
    your selves and be cleane, &amp;c. In so much as I have knowne diverse
    superstitious persons of good account, which usuallie washed all

    impossibilities; scratching out of <i>M. Mal.</i> the substance of all their
    arguments: so as their authors being disapproved, they must coine new
    stuffe, or go to their grandams maids to learne more old wives tales,

    greatest doctors of that art: out of whom I have gathered matter and
    absurditie enough, to confound the opinions conceived of witchcraft;
    although they were allowed inquisitors and assigned by the pope, with
    the authoritie and commendation of all the doctors of the universitie
    of <i>Collen</i>, &amp;c: to call before/<span class="snp" id="p_471"><i>471.</i></span> them, to imprison, to condemne, and to

    it will be hard to suppresse the credit of their writings, be they

    many times finding needdels sticking in their biggens,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>which were

    Howbeit they affirme that they will not tell all that might make to
    the manifestation of their holines: for then should their owne praise
    stinke in their owne mouthes. And yet God knoweth their whole booke
    conteineth nothing but stinking lies and poperie. Which groundworke and

    did deferre and put off purposelie: that you might perceive the true
    nature thereof, by the circumstances, and therefore the rather to allow
    of the same, seeing the varietie of other writers. Witchcraft is in
    truth a cousening art, wherin the name of God is abused, prophaned and
    blasphemed, and his power attributed to a vile creature. In estimation
    of the vulgar people, it is a supernaturall worke, contrived betweene

  <p><span class="sni">A necessarie sequele.</span>First, in that the <i>Turkes</i> and infidels, in their witchcraft, use both
    other words, and other characters than our witches doo, and also such
    as are most contrarie. In so much as, if ours be bad, in reason theirs
    should be good. If their witches can doo anie thing, ours can doo
    nothing. For as our witches are said to renounce Christ, and despise
    his sacraments: so doo the other forsake <i>Mahomet</i>, and his lawes,
    which is one large step to christianitie.</p>

    not litterallie discover, who wonderfullie abused manie in these parts,
    making them thinke he could tell where anie thing lost became: with
    diverse other such practises, whereby his fame was farre beyond the
    others. And yet on his death bed he confessed, that he knew nothing
    more than anie other, but by slight and devises, without the assistance
    of anie divell or spirit, saving the spirit of cousenage: and this did
    he (I saie) protest before manie of great honestie, credit, &amp; wisedome,
    who can witnesse the same, and also gave him good commendations for his
    godlie and honest end.</p>

  <p>Againe, who will mainteine, that common witchcrafts are not cousenages,
    when the great and famous witchcrafts, which had stolne credit not
    onlie from all the common people, but from men of great wisdome and
    authoritie, are discovered to be beggerlie slights of cousening
    varlots? Which otherwise might and would have remained a perpetuall
    objection against me. Were there not *three<span class="sni">[*] J. Bodin in the preface before his booke of

    found in a doonghill, to the terror &amp; astonishment of manie thousands?
    In so much as great matters were thought to have beene pretended to
    be doone by witchcraft. But if the Lord preserve those persons (whose
    destruction was doubted to have beene intended therby) from all other
    the lewd practises and attempts of their enimies; I feare not, but
    they shall easilie withstand these and such like devises, although
    they should indeed be practised against them. But no doubt, if such
    bables could have brought those matters of mischeefe to passe, by the
    hands of traitors, witches, or papists; we should long since have beene
    deprived of the most excellent jewell and comfort that we enjoy in this
    world. Howbeit, I confesse, that the feare, conceipt, and doubt of
    such mischeefous pretenses may breed inconvenience to them that stand
    in awe of the/<span class="snp" id="p_475"><i>475.</i></span> same. And I wish, that even for such practises, though
    they never can or doo take effect, the practisers be punished with all
    extremitie: bicause therein <span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
    is manifested a traiterous heart to the
    Queene, and a presumption against God.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Note this devise of the waxen images found of late neere
    London.</span>But to returne to the discoverie of the aforesaid knaverie and
    witchcraft. So it was that one old cousener, wanting monie, devised or
    rather practised (for it is a stale devise) to supplie his want, by
    promising a yoong Gentleman, whose humor he thought would that waie be
    well served, that for the summe of fourtie pounds, he would not faile
    by his cunning in that art of witchcraft, to procure unto him the love
    of anie three women whome he would name, and of whome he should make
    choise at his pleasure. The yoong Gentleman being abused with his
    cunning devises, and too hastilie yeelding to that motion, satisfied
    this cunning mans demand of monie. Which, bicause he had it not
    presentlie to disbursse, provided it for him at the/<span class="snp"><b>343.</b></span> hands of a freend
    of his. Finallie, this cunning man made the three puppets of wax, &amp;c:
    leaving nothing undone that appertained to the cousenage, untill he had
    buried them, as you have heard. But I omit to tell what a doo was made
    herof, and also what reports and lies were bruted; as what white dogs
    and blacke dogs there were seene in the night season passing through
    the watch, mawgre all their force and preparation against them, &amp;c.
    But the yoong Gentleman, who for a litle space remained in hope mixed
    with joy and love, now through tract of time hath those his felicities
    powdered with doubt and despaire. For in steed of atchieving his love,
    he would gladlie have obteined his monie. But bicause he could by no
    meanes get either the one or the other (his monie being in hucksters
    handling, and his sute in no better forwardnes) he revealed the whole
    matter, hoping by that meanes to recover his monie; which he neither
    can yet get againe, nor hath paied it where he borrowed. But till
    triall was had of his simplicitie or rather follie herein, he received
    some trouble himselfe hereabouts, though now dismissed./</p>

    ERE <span class="sni">A strange miracle, if it were true.</span>
    I may aptlie insert another miracle of importance, that happened
    within the compasse of a childes remembrance, which may induce anie
    resonable bodie to conceive, that these supernaturall actions are but
    fables &amp; cousenages. There was one, whom for some respects I name
    not,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
    that was taken blind, deafe, &amp; dumbe; so as no physician could
    helpe him. That man (forsooth) though he was (as is said) both blind,
    dumbe &amp; deafe, yet could he read anie canonicall scriptures; but as
    for apocrypha, he could read none: wherein a Gods name consisted the
    miracle.<span class="sni">There the hypocrite was overmatcht for all his dissembled
    gravitie.</span> But a leafe of apocrypha being extraordinarilie inserted among
    the canonicall scriptures, he read the same as authentike: wherein his
    knaverie was bewraied. Another had a divell, that answered men to all
    questions, marie hir divell could understand no Latine, and so was she
    (and by such meanes all the rest may be) bewraied. Indeed our witching
    writers saie, that certeine divels speake onelie the language of that
    countrie where they are resiant, as French, or English, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, in my conceipt, nothing prooveth more apparentlie
    that witchcraft is cousenage, and that witches instruments are but
    ridiculous bables, and altogither void of effect; than when learned
    and godlie divines, in their serious writings, produce experiments
    as wrought by witches, and by divels at witches commandements: which
    they expound by miracles, although indeed meere trifles. Whereof they

    otherwise I might justlie commend: howbeit I am sorie and ashamed to
    see his ignorance and follie in this behalfe. Neither would I have
    bewraied it, but that he himselfe, among other absurdities concerning
    the maintenance of witches omnipotencie, hath published it to his
    great discredit. Popish preests (saith he) as the <i>Chaldæans</i> used
    the divination by sive &amp; sheeres*<span class="sni">[* p. <i>262</i>]</span> for the detection of theft,
    doo practise with a psalter and a keie fastned upon the 49. psalme,
    to discover a theefe. And when the names of the suspected persons
    are orderlie put into the pipe of the keie, at the reading of these
    words of the psalme [If thou sawest a theefe thou diddest consent unto
    him]†<span class="sni"> [† [] in text]</span> the booke will <span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>wagge, and fall out of the fingers of them
    that hold it, and he whose name remaineth in the keie must be the
    theefe. Hereupon <i>Hemingius</i><span class="sni">The greatest clarkes are not the wisest men.</span> inferreth, that although conjuring preests
    and witches bring not this to passe by the absolute words of the
    psalme, which tend to a farre other scope; yet sathan dooth nimblie,
    with his invisible hand, give such a twitch to the booke, as also in
    the other case to the sive and the sheeres, that downe falles the booke
    and keie, sive and sheeres, up starts the theefe, and awaie runneth the
    divell laughing, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>But alas, <i>Hemingius</i> is deceived, as not perceiving the conceipt, or
    rather the deceipt hereof. For where he supposeth those actions to be
    miraculous, and done by a divell; they are in truth/<span class="snp" id="p_478"><i>478.</i></span> meere bables,
    wherein consisteth not so much as legierdemaine. For everie carter
    may conceive the slight hereof: bicause the booke and keie, sive
    and sheeres, being staied up in that order,<span class="sni">A naturall reason of the former knacke.</span> by naturall course, of
    necessitie must within that space (by meanes of the aire, and the pulse
    beating at the fingers end) turne and fall downe. Which experience
    being knowne to the witch or conjuror, she or he doo forme and frame
    their prophesie accordinglie: as whosoever maketh proofe thereof shall
    manifestlie perceive it. By this art, practise, or experience, you
    shall knowe what it is a clocke, if you hold betweene your finger and
    your thumbe a thred of six or seven inches long, unto the other end
    whereof is tied a gold ring, or some such like thing: in such sort as
    upon the beating of your pulse, and the mooving of the ring, the same
    may strike upon either side of a goblet or glasse. These things are
    (I confesse) witchcraft, bicause the effect or event proceedeth not
    of that cause which such couseners saie, and others beleeve they doo.
    As when they laie a medicine for the ague, &amp;c: to a childs wrists,
    they also pronounce certeine words or charmes, by vertue whereof (they
    saie)/<span class="snp"><b>345.</b></span> the child is healed: whereas indeed the medicine onelie dooth
    the feate. And this is also a sillie jugglers knacke, which wanteth
    legierdemaine, whom you shall see to thrust a pinne, or a small knife,
    through the head and braine of a chicken or pullet, and with certeine

    were spoken, the chicken would live, and doo well enough; as experience
    teacheth and declareth.</p>

  <p>Againe, when such as have mainteined the art and profession of
    conjuring, and have written thereupon most cunninglie, have published
    recantations, and confessed the deceipts thereof, as <i>Cornelius
    Agrippa</i> <span class="sni"><i>C. Agripp. in lib. de vanit. scient. &amp; in epistola ante
    librum de occulta philosophia.</i></span>did, whie should we defend it? Also, when heathen princes,
    of great renowne, authoritie, &amp; learning, have searched, with much
    industrie and charge, the knowledge &amp; secrecie of conjuration and
    witchcraft, &amp; finallie found by experience all to be false and vaine
    that is reported <span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
    of them, as <span class="sni"><i>Plin. lib. natural. hist. 30. cap. 1.</i>
    <i>Pet. Mart. in locis communibus.</i></span><i>Nero</i>, <i>Julianus apostata</i>, and
    <i>Valence</i> did; whie should we seeke for further triall, to proove
    witchcraft and conjuration to be cousenage?</p>

  <p>Also, when the miracles imputed unto them, exceed in quantitie,
    qualitie and number, all the miracles that Christ wrought here upon
    earth, for the establishing of his gospell, for the confir/mation<span class="snp" id="p_479"><i>479.</i></span> of
    our faith, and for the advancement of his glorious name; what good
    christian will beleeve them to be true? And when Christ himselfe saith;
    The works that I doo, no man else can accomplish; whie should we thinke
    that a foolish old woman can doo them all, and manie more?</p>

  <p>Also, when Christ knew not these witches, nor spake one word of them
    in all the time of his being here upon earth, having such necessarie
    occasion (if at leastwise they with their familiars could doo as he
    did by the spirit of God, as is constantlie affirmed) whie should
    we suppose that they can doo as they saie, but rather that they are
    deceivers[?*]<span class="sni">[* text (.)]</span> When they are faine to saie, that witches wrought not
    in that art, all those thirtie three yeares that Christ lived,<span class="sni">Note that during all Christs time upon earth, which was 33.
    yeares, witches were put to silence, &amp;c.</span> and that
    there were none in <i>Jobs</i> time, and that the cousening oracles are now
    ceased; who seeth not that they are witlesse, and madde fooles that
    mainteine it? When all the mischeefes are accomplished by poisons and
    naturall meanes, which they affirme to be brought to passe by words,
    it manifesteth to the world their cousenage. When all the places of
    scripture, which witchmongers allowe for the proofe of such witches,
    are prooved to make nothing for their purpose, their own fables &amp; lies
    deserve small credit. When one of the cheefe points in controversie;
    to wit, execution of witches, is grounded upon a false translation;
    namelie, You shall not suffer a witch to live (which is in Latine,†<span class="sni">[† Not in Vulg.]</span>
    <i>Veneficam non retinebitis in vita</i>) where the word in everie mans
    eare soundeth to be a poisoner, rather than a worker of miracles, and
    so interpreted by the seventie interpretors, <i>Josephus</i>, and almost
    of all the <i>Rabbins</i>, which were <i>Hebrues</i> borne: whie should anie of
    their interpretations or allegations be trusted, or well accounted
    of? When working of miracles is ceased, and the gift of prophesie
    also; so as the godlie, through invocation of the holie spirit, cannot
    performe such wonderfull things, as these witches and conjurors by
    the invocation of divels and wicked spirits undertake, and are said
    to doo; what man that knoweth and honoureth God will be so in/fatuate<span class="snp"><b>346.</b></span>
    as to beleeve these lies, and so preferre the power of witches and
    divels before the godlie endued with Gods holie spirit? When manie
    printed bookes are published, even with authoritie, in confirmation
    of such miracles wrought by those couseners, for the detection of
    witchcraft;/<span class="snp" id="p_480"><i>480.</i></span> and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
    in fine all is not onelie found false, and to have
    beene accomplished by cousenage, but that there hath beene therein
    a set purpose to defame honest matrones, as to make them be thought
    to be witches: whie should we beleeve <i>Bodin</i>, <i>M. Mal. &amp;c</i>: in their
    cousening tales and fables? When they saie that witches can flie in
    the aire, and come in at a little coane,‡<span class="sni">[‡ = crack]<br />[‡ Cf. p. <i>91</i>.]</span> or a hole in a glasse
    windowe, and steale awaie sucking children, and hurt their mothers; and
    yet when they are brought into prison, they cannot escape out of the
    grate, which is farre bigger: who will not condemne such accusations or
    confessions to be frivolous, &amp;c? When (if their assertions were true)
    concerning the divels usuall taking of shapes, and walking, talking,
    conferring, hurting, and all maner of dealing with mortall creatures,
    Christs argument<span class="sni">But Christs argument was undoubted: <i>Ergo, &amp;c.</i></span> to <i>Thomas</i> had beene weake and easilie answered; yea
    the one halfe, or all the whole world might be inhabited by divels,
    everie poore mans house might be hired over his head by a divell, he
    might take the shape and favor of an honest woman, and plaie the witch;
    or of an honest man, and plaie the theefe, and so bring them both,
    or whome he list to the gallowes: who seeth not the vanitie of such
    assertions? For then the divell might in the likenes of an honest man
    commit anie criminall offense; as <i>Lavater</i> in his nineteenth chapter
    <i>De spectris</i> reporteth of a grave wise magistrate in the territorie
    of <i>Tigurie</i>, who affirmed, that as he and his servant went through
    certeine pastures, he espied in a morning, the divell in likenes of one
    whome he knew verie well, wickedlie dealing with a mare.<span class="sni">I marvell for what purpose the magistrate went to that
    fellowes house.</span> Upon the sight
    whereof he immediatlie went to that fellowes house, and certeinlie
    learned there, that the same person went not out of his chamber that
    daie. And if he had not wiselie boolted out the matter, the good honest
    man (saith he) had surelie beene cast into prison, and put on the
    racke, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Albertus Crantzius in lib. 4. metropolis. cap. 4.</i></span>
    The like storie we read of one <i>Cunegunda</i>, wife to <i>Henrie</i> the second
    emperor of that name, in whose chamber the divell (in the likenes of a
    yoongman, with whome she was suspected to be too familiar in court) was
    often seene comming in and out. How beit, she was purged by the triall

    everie pulpit, and spred heresies, as I doubt not but he dooth in the
    mouth of wicked preachers, though not so grosselie as is imagined and
    reported by the papists and witchmongers. And because it shall not

    popish charmes, conjurations, execrations, and benedictions are not

    confesse, that there can be no such conference betweene a spirituall
    divell and a corporall witch, as is supposed. For no doubt, all the
    heathen would/<span class="snp" id="p_484"><i>484.</i></span> then have everie one his familiar divell; for they would

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_m1.png" width="75" height="75" alt='M' /></span>ANIE
    writers agree with <i>Virgil</i> and <i>Theocritus</i> in the effect of
    witching eies, affirming that in <i>Scythia</i>, there are women called
    <i>Bithiæ</i>,<span class="sni">With the like propertie were the old Illyrian people indued:
    if we will credit the words of Sabinus grounded upon the report of Aul.
    Gell.</span> having two balles or rather blacks in the apple of their
    eies. And as <i>Didymus</i> reporteth, some have in the one eie two such
    balles, and in the other the image of a horsse. These (forsooth) with
    their angrie lookes doo bewitch and hurt not onelie yoong lambs, but
    yoong children. There be other that/<span class="snp"><b>350.</b></span> reteine such venome in their
    eies, and send it foorth by beames and streames so violentlie, that
    therewith they annoie not onlie them with whom they are conversant
    continuallie; but also all other, whose companie they frequent, of what
    age, strength, or complexion soever they be: as <i>Cicero</i>, <i>Plutarch</i>,
  <i>Philarchus</i>, and manie others give out in their writings.</p>

  <p>This fascination (saith <i>John Baptista Porta Neapolitanus</i>)
    <span class="sni"><i>J. Bap. Neapol. in lib. de naturali magia.</i></span> though it
    begin by touching or breathing, is alwaies accomplished and finished
    by the eie, as an extermination or expulsion of the spirits
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span> through
    the eies, approching to the hart of the bewitched, and infecting the
    same, &amp;c. Wherby it commeth to passe, that a child, or a yoong man
    endued with a cleare, whole, subtill and sweet bloud, yeeldeth the
    like spirits, breath, and vapors springing from the purer bloud of the
    hart. And the lightest and finest/<span class="snp" id="p_486"><i>486.</i></span> spirits, ascending into the highest
    parts of the head, doo fall into the eies, and so are from thence sent
    foorth, as being of all other parts of the bodie the most cleare,
    and fullest of veines and pores, and with the verie spirit or vapor
    proceeding thence, is conveied out as it were by beames and streames
    a certeine fierie force;<span class="sni">This is held of some for truth.</span> whereof he that beholdeth sore eies shall
    have good experience. For the poison and disease in the eie infecteth
    the aire next unto it, and the same proceedeth further, carrieng with
    it the vapor and infection of the corrupted bloud: with the contagion
    whereof, the eies of the beholders are most apt to be infected. By this
    same meanes it is thought that the cockatrice depriveth the life, and a
    woolfe taketh awaie the voice of such as they suddenlie meete withall
    and behold.</p>

  <p>Old women, in whome the ordinarie course of nature faileth in the
    office of purging their naturall monethlie humors, shew also some
    proofe hereof. For (as the said <i>J.B.P.N.</i> reporteth, alledging
    <i>Aristotle</i> for his author) they leave in a looking glasse a certeine
    froth, by meanes of the grosse vapors proceeding out of their eies.
    Which commeth so to passe, bicause those vapors or spirits, which so
    abundantlie come from their eies, cannot pearse and enter into the
    glasse, which is hard, and without pores, and therefore resisteth:
    <span class="sni"><i>Non est in speculo res quæ speculatur in eo.</i></span>
    but the beames which are carried in the chariot or conveiance of the
    spirits, from the eies of one bodie to another, doo pearse to the
    inward parts, and there breed infection, whilest they search and seeke
    for their proper region. And as these beames &amp; vapors doo proceed from
    the hart of the one, so are they turned into bloud about the hart of
    the other: which bloud disagreeing with the nature of the
    bewitched partie, infeebleth the rest of his bodie, and
    maketh him sicke: the contagion wherof so long con-
    tinueth, as the distempered bloud hath force in the
    members. And bicause the infection is of bloud,
    the fever or sicknes will be continuall;
    whereas if it were of choler, or
    flegme, it would be
    intermittent or
    alterable.//</p>

  <p class="drop-img">

    HERE <span class="sni"><i>H. Card. lib. de var. rer. 16. cap. 93.</i></span>
    is no question nor theme (saith <i>Hierome Cardane</i>) so difficult
    to deale in, nor so noble an argument to dispute upon, as this of
    divels and spirits. For that being confessed or doubted of, the
    eternitie of the soule is either affirmed or denied. The heathen
    philosophers reson hereof amongest themselves in this sort. First,
    <span class="sni">The Platonists and Stoiks.</span> they
    that mainteine the perpetuitie of the soule, saie that if the soule
    died with the bodie; to what end should men take paines either to live
    well or die well, when no reward for vertue nor punishment for vice
    insueth after this life, the which otherwise they might spend in ease
    and securitie? The other sort<span class="sni">The Epicureans and Peripatetiks.</span>
    saie that vertue and honestie is to be
    pursued, <i>Non spe præmii, sed virtutis amore</i>, that is, Not for hope of
    reward, but for love of vertue. If the soule live ever (saie the other)
    the least portion of life is here. And therefore we that mainteine the
    perpetuitie of the soule, may be of the better comfort and courage,
    to susteine with more constancie the losse of children, yea and the
    losse of life it selfe: whereas, if the/<span class="snp" id="p_490"><i>490.</i></span> soule were mortall, all
    our hope and felicitie were to be placed in this life, which manie
    Atheists (I warrant you) at this daie doo. But both the one and the
    other missed the cushion. For, to doo anie thing without Christ, is
    to wearie our selves in vaine; sith in him onelie our corruptions are
    purged. And therefore the follie of the Gentils, that place <i>Summum
    bonum</i><span class="sni"><i>Summum bonum</i> cannot consist in the happines of the bodie
    or mind.</span> in the felicitie of the bodie, or in the happines or pleasures
    of the mind, is not onelie to be derided, but also abhorred. For, both
    our bodies and minds are intermedled with most miserable calamities:
    and therefore therin cannot consist perfect felicitie. But in the
    word of God is exhibited and offered unto us that hope which is most
    certeine, absolute, sound &amp; sincere, not to be answered or denied
    by the judgement of philosophers themselves.<span class="sni">Morall tēperance.</span> For they that preferre
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
    temperance before all other things as <i>Summum bonum</i>, must needs
    see it to be but a witnesse of their naturall calamitie, corruption
    and wickednes; and that it serveth for nothing, but to restraine the
    dissolutenes, which hath place in their minds infected with vices;
    which are to be bridled with such corrections: yea and the best of
    them all faileth in some point of modestie. Wherefore serveth our
    philosophers prudence,<span class="sni">Morall prudence.</span> but to provide for their owne follie and
    miserie; whereby they might else be utterlie overthrowne? And if their
    nature were not intangled in errors, they should have no need/<span class="snp"><b>353.</b></span> of such
    circumspection. <span class="sni">Morall justice.</span>The justice whereof they speake, serveth but to keepe
    them from ravine, theft, and violence: and yet none of them all are so
    just, but that the verie best and uprightest of them fall into great
    infirmities, both dooing and suffering much wrong and injurie. And what
    is their fortitude,<span class="sni">Morall fortitude.</span> but to arme them to endure miserie, greefe, danger,
    and death it selfe? But what happinesse or goodnesse is to be reposed
    in that life, which must be waited upon with such calamities, and
    finallie must have the helpe of death to finish it? I saie, if it be so
    miserable, why doo they place <i>Summum bonum</i><span class="sni">Rom. 2.</span> therein? S. <i>Paule</i> to the
    <i>Romans</i> sheweth, that it cannot be that we should atteine to justice,
    through the morall and naturall actions and duties of this life:
    bicause that never the Jewes nor the Gentiles could expresse so much in
    their lives, as the verie lawe of nature or of <i>Moses</i> required. And
    therefore he that worketh without Christ, doth as he that reckoneth
    without his host./</p>

    whereby certeine vermine are ingendered; and that they are nourished
    with food, as we are, saving that they receive it not into their
    mouthes, but sucke it up into their bodies,<span class="sni"><i>Idem. cap. 10.</i></span> in such sort as sponges
    soke up water. Also he saith they have names, shapes, and dwelling
    places, as indeed they have, though not in temporall and corporall sort.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Idem ibid. cap. 11.</i></span>Furthermore, he saith, that there are six principall kind of divels,
    which are not onelie corporall, but temporall and worldlie.<span class="sni">Oh hethenish, nay oh papisticall follie!</span> The first
    sort consist of fier, wandering in the region neere to the moone, but/<span class="snp"><b>355.</b></span>
    have no power to go into the moone. The second sort consisting of aire,
    have their habitation more lowe and neere unto us: these (saith he)
    are proud and great boasters, verie wise and deceitfull, and when they
    come downe are seene shining with streames of fier at their taile. He
    <span class="sni">The opinions of all papists.</span>saith
    that these are commonlie conjured up to make images laugh, and
    lamps burne of their owne accord; and that in <i>Assyria</i> they use much
    to prophesie in a bason of water. <span class="sni">A cousening knaverie.</span>Which kind of incantation is usuall
    among our conjurors: but it is here commonlie performed in a pitcher or
    pot of water; or else in a violl of glasse filled with water, wherin
    they say at the first a litle sound is heard without a voice, which is
    a token of the divels comming. Anon the water seemeth to be troubled,
    and then there are heard small voices,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
    wherewith they give their
    answers, speaking so softlie as no man can well heare them: bicause
    (saith <i>Cardane</i>)<span class="sni"><i>H. Card. lib. de var. rer. 16.
    cap. 93.</i></span> they would not be argued or rebuked of lies. But
    this I have else-where more largelie described and confuted. The third
    sort of divels <i>Psellus</i> saith are earthlie; the fourth waterie, or of
    the sea; the fift under the earth; the sixt sort are <i>Lucifugi</i>, that
    is, such as delight in darkenes, &amp; are scant indued with sense, and so
    dull, as they can scarse be mooved with charmes or conjurations./</p>

  <p><span class="snp" id="p_494"><i>494.</i></span>The same man saith, that some divels are woorse than other, but yet
    that they all hate God, and are enimies to man. But the woorser moitie
    of divels are<span class="sni">Divels of diverse natures, and their operations.</span> <i>Aquei</i>,
    <i>Subterranei</i>, and <i>Lucifugi</i>;*<span class="sni">[* These three Ital.]</span> that is,
    waterie, under the earth, and shunners of light: bicause (saith he)
    these hurt not the soules of men, but destroie mens bodies like mad and
    ravening beasts, molesting both the inward and outward parts thereof.
    <i>Aquei</i> are they that raise tempests, and drowne seafaring men, and
    doo all other mischeefes on the water. <i>Subterranei</i> and <i>Lucifugi</i>
    enter into the bowels of men, and torment them that they possesse with
    the phrensie, and the falling evill. They also assault them that are
    miners or pioners, which use to worke in deepe and darke holes under
    the earth. Such divels as are earthie and aierie, he saith enter by
    subtiltie into the minds of men, to deceive them, provoking men to
    absurd and unlawfull affections.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The former opinion confuted.</span>But herein his philosophie is verie unprobable, for if the divell be
    earthie, he must needs be palpable; if he be palpable, he must needs
    kill them into whose bodies he entereth. Item, if he be of earth
    created, then must he also be visible and untransformable in that
    point: for Gods creation cannot be annihilated by the creature. So as,
    though it were granted, that they might adde to their substance matter
    and forme, &amp;c: yet is it most certeine, that they cannot diminish or
    alter the substance whereof they consist, as not to be (when they list)
    spirituall, or to relinquish and leave earth, water, fier, aier, or
    this and that element whereof they are created. But howsoever they
    imagine of water, aier, or fier, I am sure earth must alwaies be
    visible and palpable; yea, and aier must alwaies be invisible,
    and fier must be hot, and water must be moist. And of these
    three latter bodies, speciallie of water and aier, no
    forme nor shape can be exhibited to
    mortall eies naturallie, or by

    the eare need not heare him; and that everie part of a divell or spirit
    seeth, heareth, and speaketh, &amp;c. But herein I will beleeve <i>Paule</i>
    better than <i>Psellus</i>,<span class="sni">1. Cor. 12.</span> or his monke, or the moonks divell. For <i>Paule</i>
    saith; If the whole bodie were an eie, where were hearing? If the whole
    bodie were hearing, where were smelling, &amp;c. Whereby you may see what
    accord is betwixt Gods word and witchmongers.</p>

  <p>The papists proceed in this matter, and saie, that these spirits use
    great knaverie and unspeakeable bawderie in the breech and middle parts
    of man and woman, by tickeling, and by other lecherous devises; so that
    they fall jumpe in judgement and opinion, though verie erroniouslie,
    with the foresaid <i>Psellus</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Psellus. ibid. cap.

    being brought up in deepe, drie and cold places: marie they hate the
    heate of the sun and the fier, bicause that kind of heate drieth too
    fast. They throwe downe stones upon men, but the blowes thereof doo
    no harme to them whome they hit; bicause they are not cast with anie

    may be compared to flies, fleas, and wormes, who have no respect to any
    thing but their food, not regarding or remembring the hole from out of
    whence they came last. Marrie divels compounded of earth, cannot often
    transforme themselves, but abide in some one shape, such as they best
    like, and most delight in; to wit, in the shape of birds or women: and
    therefore the Greeks call them <i>Neidas</i>, <i>Nereidas</i>, and <i>Dreidas</i>
    in the feminine gender; which <i>Dreidæ</i> inhabited (as some write) the
    ilands beside <i>Scotland</i> called <i>Druidæ</i>, which by that meanes had
    their denomination and name. Other divels that dwell in drier places
    transforme themselves into the masculine kind. Finallie <i>Psellus</i>
    saith they know our thoughts, and can prophesie of things to come.<span class="sni">But
    <i>Psellus</i> sawe nothing himselfe.</span> His
    definition is, that they are perpetuall minds in a passible bodie.</p>

  <p>To verefie these toies he saith, that he himselfe sawe in a certeine

    of divels, and perceived a crowe to flie into his mouth; and since
    that houre he could prophesie at all times, saving on good fridaie,
    and easter sundaie. If the end of this tale were true, it might not
    onelie have satisfied the Greeke church, in keeping the daie of easter,
    togither with the church of <i>Rome</i>; but might also have made the pope
    (that now is) content with our christmas and easter daie, and not to
    have gathered the minuts together, and reformed it so, as to shew how
    falselie he and his predecessors (whome they saie could not erre) have
    observed it hitherto. And trulie this, and the dansing of the sunne on

    lived two or three hundred yeares; and they said that their soules/<span class="snp" id="p_498"><i>498.</i></span> and

    otherwise, Couseners. Item, they saie that fierie spirits urge men to
    contemplation, the aierie to busines, the waterie to lust; and among
    these there are some that are Martiall, which give fortitude; some are
    Joviall, giving wisedome; some Saturniall, alwaies using dissuasion and

    dooth not much swarve, saving that he dealeth (as he saith) onelie with

    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span> were
    made. <i>Laurence Ananias</i><span class="sni"><i>Laur. Anan. lib. de
    natur. dæm. 1.</i></span> saith, they were made the first daie, and
    could not be made the fourth daie, bicause it is written; <i>Quando facta
      sunt sidera, laudaverunt me angeli</i>: so as (saith he) they were made
    under the name of the<span class="sni"><i>Crœavit* cælum &amp; terram.</i></span>
    <span class="sni">[* <i>Creavit</i>]<br />[* Gen. 1. 1. Vulg.]</span> heavens.</p>

  <p>There is also a great question among the schoolemen, whether more
    angels fell downe with <i>Lucifer</i>, or remained in heaven with <i>Michael</i>.
    Manie having a bad opinion of the angels honesties, affirme that the
    greater part fell with <i>Lucifer</i>: but the better opinion is (saith
    <i>Laurentius Ananias</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Lau. Anan. lib. de natur.
    dæm. 1.</i></span> that the most part remained. And of them that
    thinke so, some saie the tenth part were cast downe, some the ninth;
    and some gather upon <i>S. John</i>, that the third part were onelie damned;
    bicause it is written, that the dragon with his taile plucked downe
    with him the third part of the starres./</p>

    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_t.png" width="75" height="75" alt='T' /></span>
    HERE was also another contention betweene the Greeke church and the
    Latine; to wit, of what orders of angels they were that did fall with
    <i>Lucifer</i>. Our schoolemen saie they were of all the nine orders of
    angels in <i>Lucifers</i> conspiracie. But bicause the superior order was
    of the more noble constitution and excellent estate, and the inferior
    of a lesse worthie nature, the more part of the inferior orders
    fell as guiltie and offenders with <i>Lucifer</i>.<span class="sni"><i>Lau. Anan. lib. de natur. dæm. 1.</i></span> Some saie the divell
    himselfe was of the inferior order of angels, and some that he was
    of the highest order: bicause it is written, <i>In cherubim extentus
      &amp; protegens posui te in monte sancto Dei</i>. And these saie further,
    that he was called the dragon, bicause of his excellent knowledge.
    Finallie, these great doctors conclude, that the divell himselfe was
    of the order of seraphim, which is the highest, because it is written,
    <i>Quomodo enim manè oriebaris Lucifer?</i>*<span class="sni">[* Isai. 14. 12]</span> They of this sect affirme,
    that <i>Cacodæmones</i> were they that rebelled against <i>Jove</i>; I meane
    they of <i>Plato</i> his sect, himselfe also holding the same opinion.<span class="sni">I
    will settle my selfe in the north, and will be like the highest.</span> Our
    schoolemen differ much in the cause of <i>Lucifers</i> fall. For some said
    it was for speaking these words, <i>Ponam sedem meam in aquilone, &amp;
      similis ero altissimo</i>:†<span class="sni">[† Isai. 14. 13, 14]</span> others saie, bicause he utterlie refused
    felicitie, and thought scorne therof; others saie, bicause he thought
    all his strength proceeded from him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
    selfe, and not from God; others
    saie that it was, bicause he attempted to doo that by himselfe, and
    his owne abilitie, which he should have obteined by the gift of
    another;/<span class="snp"><b>362.</b></span> others saie, that his condemnation grew hereupon, for that he
    challenged the place of the Messias; others saie, bicause he detracted
    the time to adore the majestie of God, as other angels did; others
    saie, bi/cause<span class="snp" id="p_504"><i>504.</i></span> he utterlie refused it. <i>Scotus</i> and his disciples saie
    that it was, bicause he rebelliouslie claimed equall omnipotencie with
    God: with whom lightlie the <i>Thomists</i> never agree. Others saie it was
    for all these causes together, and manie more: so as hereupon (saith
    <i>Laurentius Ananias</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Laur. Anan. lib. de natur.
    dæm. 1.</i></span> grew a wonderfull conflict betweene <i>Michaël</i> and
    the good angels on the one side, and <i>Lucifer</i> and his freends on the
    other: so as, after a long and doubtfull skirmish, <i>Michaël</i> overthrew
    <i>Lucifer</i>, and turned him and his fellowes out of the doores.</p>

  <h3>The tenth Chapter.</h3>

  <p class="subhead"><i>Where the battell betweene Michael and Lucifer was fought, how
    long it continued, and of their power, how fondlie papists

    OW where this battell was fought, and how long it continued, there
    is as great contention among the schoolemen, as was betwixt <i>Michaël</i>
    and <i>Lucifer</i>. The <i>Thomists</i> saie this battell was fought in the
    mpereiall*<span class="sni">[* <i>sic</i>]</span> heaven, where the abode is of blessed spirits, and the
    place of pleasure and felicitie. <i>Augustine</i> and manie others saie,
    that the battell was fought in the highest region of the aier; others
    saie, in the firmament; others in paradise. The <i>Thomists</i><span class="sni"><i>Instans,
    viz. punctum temp. nempe individuum Nunc.</i></span> also saie
    it continued but one instant or pricke of time; for they tarried but
    two instants in all, even from their creation to their expulsion.
    The <i>Scotists</i> saie, that betweene their production and their fall,
    there were just foure instants. Nevertheles, the greatest number of
    schoolemen affirme, that they continued onelie three instants: bicause
    it stood with Gods justice, to give them three warnings; so as at the
    third warning <i>Lucifer</i> fell downe like led (for so are the words) to
    the bottome of hell; the rest were left in the aire, to tempt man.
    The <i>Sadduces</i> were as grosse the other waie: for they said, that by
    angels was ment nothing else, but the motion that God dooth inspire in
    men, or the/<span class="snp" id="p_505"><i>505.</i></span> tokens of his power. He that readeth <i>Eusebius</i> shall see
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>manie more<span class="sni"><i>Euseb.
    in ecclesi. histor.</i></span> absurd opinions and asseverations of angels: as how manie
    thousand yeares they serve as angels, before they come to the promotion
    of archangels, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Monsieur Bodin</i>, <i>M. Mal.</i> and manie other papists gather upon the
    seventh of <i>Daniel</i>, that there are just ten millians<span class="sni"><i>10000000. Johannes Cassianus in confessione theolog.
    tripart.</i></span> of angels in
    heaven. Manie saie that angels are not by nature, but by office.
    Finallie, it were infinite to shew the absurd and curious collections
    hereabout. I for my part thinke with <i>Calvine</i>, that angels are
    creatures of God; though <i>Moses</i> spake nothing of their creation,
    who onelie applied himselfe to the capacitie of the common people,
    reciting nothing but things seene. And I saie further with him, that
    they are heavenlie spirits, whose ministration and service God useth:
    and in that respect are called angels. I saie yet againe with him,/<span class="snp"><b>363.</b></span>
    that it is verie certeine,<span class="sni"><i>J. Cal. lib. instit. 1.
    cap. 14. sect. 8.</i></span> that they have no shape at all; for they
    are spirits, who never have anie: and finallie, I saie with him, that
    the scriptures, for the capacitie of our wit, dooth not in vaine paint
    out angels unto us with wings; bicause we should conceive, that they
    are readie swiftlie to succour us. And certeinlie all the sounder
    divines doo conceive and give out, that both the names and also the
    number of angels are set downe in the scripture by the Holie-ghost, in
    termes to make us understand the greatnesse and the manner of their
    messages; which (I saie) are either expounded by the number of angels,
    or signified by their names.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Mich. And. thes. 107. 101. Idem thes. 103. 108.</i></span>Furthermore, the schoole doctors affirme, that foure of the superior
    orders of angels never take anie forme or shape of bodies, neither are
    sent of anie arrand at anie time. As for archangels, they are sent
    onelie about great and secret matters; and angels are common hacknies
    about evere trifle; and that these can take what shape or bodie they
    list: marie they never take the forme of women or children. Item they
    saie that angels take most terrible shapes: for <i>Gabriel</i> appeared
    to <i>Marie</i>, when he saluted hir, <i>Facie rutilante, veste coruscante,
      ingressu mirabili, aspectu terribili, &amp;c</i>: that is, with a bright
    countenance, shining attire, wonderfull gesture, and a dredful vissage,
    &amp;c. But of apparitions I have spoken somewhat before, and will saie
    more hearafter. It hath beene long, and continueth yet a constant
    opinion, not one/lie<span class="snp" id="p_506"><i>506.</i></span> among the papists; but among others also, that
    everie man hath assigned him, at the time of his nativitie, a good
    angell and a bad. For the which there is no reason in nature, nor
    authoritie in scripture. For not one angell, but all the angels are
    said to rejoise more of one convert, than of ninetie and nine just.
    Neither did one onelie angell conveie <i>Lazarus</i><span class="sni">Luk. 15, 7.<br />Luk. 16, 23.<br />
    <i>J. Cal. lib. instit. 1. cap. 14.</i></span> into <i>Abrahams</i> bosome.
    And therefore I conclude with <i>Calvine</i>, that he which referreth to one
    angell, the care that GOD hath to everie one
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span> of us, dooth himselfe
    great wrong: as may appeare by so manie fierie chariots shewed by
    <i>Elizæus</i><span class="sni">2. Reg. 16. 17</span> to his servant. But touching this mysterie of angels, let us
    reverentlie thinke of them, and not curiouslie search into the nature
    of them, considering the vilenes of our condition, in respect of the
    glorie of their creation. And as for the foresaid fond imaginations and
    fables of <i>Lucifer</i>, <i>&amp;c</i>: they are such as are not onelie ridiculous,
    but also accomptable among those impious curiosities, and vaine
    questions, which <i>Paule</i> speaketh of: neither have they anie tittle or
    letter in the scripture for the maintenance of their grosse opinions in
    this behalfe.</p>

  <h3>The eleventh Chapter.</h3>

  <p class="subhead"><i>Whether they became divels which being angels kept not
    their vocation, in Jude and Peter; of the fond opinions of
    the Rabbins touching spirits and bugs, with a confutation
    thereof.</i></p>

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_w.png" width="75" height="75" alt='W' /></span>
    E doo read in <i>Jude</i>,<span class="sni">Jud. vers. 6. 2. Pet. 2. 4.</span> and
    find it confirmed in <i>Peter</i>, that the
    angels kept not their first estate, but left their owne habitation, and
    sinned, and (as <i>Job</i> saith) committed follie: and that God therefore
    did cast/<span class="snp"><b>364.</b></span> them downe into hell, reserving them in everlasting chaines
    under darkenes, unto the judgement of the great daie. But manie divines
    saie, that they find not anie where, that God made divels of them, or
    that they became the princes of the world, or else of the aire; but
    rather prisoners. Howbeit, divers doctors affirme, that this <i>Lucifer</i>,
    <span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef. par. 2. quæ 1. cap. 2. 3.</i></span>
    notwithstanding his fall, hath/<span class="snp" id="p_507"><i>507.</i></span> greater power than any of the angels
    in heaven: marrie they say that there be certeine other<span class="sni"><i>Mal.
    malef. part. 2. cap. 1. quæst. 1.</i></span> divels of
    the inferiour sort of angels, which were then thrust out for smaller
    faults, and therefore are tormented with little paines, besides eternal
    damnation: and these (saie they) can doo little hurt. They affirme
    also, that they onelie use certeine jugling knacks, delighting thereby
    <span class="sni"><i>Mich. And. Laur. Anan. Mal. malef. &amp;c.</i></span>
    to make men laugh, as they travell by the high waies: but other (saie
    they) are much more churlish. For proofe heereof they alledge the
    eighth of <i>Matthew</i>, where he would none otherwise be satisfied but by
    exchange, from the annoieng of one man, to the destruction of a whole
    heard of swine. The <i>Rabbines</i>, and namelie <i>Rabbi Abraham</i>,
    <span class="sni"><i>Author. lib. Zeor hammor in Gen. 2.</i></span> writing
    upon the second of Genesis, doo say, that God made the fairies, bugs,
    <i>Incubus</i>, Robin good fellow, and other familiar or domesticall spirits
    &amp; divels on the fridaie: and being prevented with the evening of the
    sabboth, finished them not, but left them unperfect; and therefore that
    ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
    since they use to flie the holinesse of the sabboth, seeking
    darke holes in mountaines and woods, wherein they hide themselves till
    the end of the sabboth, and then come abroad to trouble and molest men.</p>

  <p>But as these opinions are ridiculous and fondlie collected; so if we
    have onelie respect to the bare word, or rather to the letter, where
    spirits or divels are spoken of in the scriptures, we shall run into as
    dangerous absurdities as these are. <span class="sni">The grosse dulnesse of manie at the hearing of a spirit
    named.</span>For some are so carnallie minded,
    that a spirit is no sooner spoken of, but immediatlie they thinke of
    a blacke man with cloven feet, a paire of hornes, a taile, clawes,
    and eies as broad as a bason, &amp;c. But surelie the divell were not so
    wise in his generation, as I take him to be, if he would terrifie men
    with such uglie shapes, though he could doo it at his pleasure. For by
    that meanes men should have good occasion &amp; oportunitie to flie from
    him, &amp; to run to God for succour; as the maner is of all them that are
    terrified, though perchance they thought not upon God of long time
    before. But in truth we never have so much cause to be afraid of the
    divell, as when he flatteringlie insinuateth himselfe into our harts,
    to satisfie, please, and serve our humors, entising us to prosecute our
    owne appetits and pleasures, without anie of these externall terrors. I
    would weete of these men, where they doo find in the scrip/tures,<span class="snp" id="p_508"><i>508.</i></span> that
    some divels be spirituall, and some corporall; or how these earthie
    or waterie divels enter into the mind of man. <i>Augustine</i>
    <span class="sni"><i>Aug. in ser. 4.<br />Greg. 29. sup. Job.<br />
    Leo pont. ser. 8. Nativit.</i></span> saith, and
    diverse others affirme, that sathan or the divell while we feed,
    allureth us with gluttonie: he thrusteth lust into our generation;
    and sloth into our exercise; into our conversation, envie; into our
    traffike, avarice; into our correction, wrath; into our government,
    pride: he putteth into our harts evill cogitations; into our mouthes,
    lies, &amp;c. When we wake, he mooveth us to evill works; when we sleepe,
    to evill and filthie dreames; he provoketh the merrie to loosenesse,
    and the sad to despaire./</p>

  <h3 title="The twelfe Chapter.">The twelfe Chapter.<span class="medium"><span class="snp"><b>365.</b></span></span></h3>

  <p class="subheadc"><i>That the divels assaults are spirituall and not temporall, and

    PON that, which hitherto hath beene said, you see that the assaults
    of sathan are spirituall, and not temporall: in which respect <i>Paule</i>
    wisheth us not to provide a corselet of Steele to defend us from his
    clawes; but biddeth us put on the whole armour of God,<span class="sni">Ephe. 6, 11, 12.</span>> that we may be
    able to stand against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
    the invasions of the divell. For we wrestle
    not against flesh and bloud; but against principalities, powers, and
    spirituall wickednesse.<span class="sni">2. Tim. 2, 8, 9.</span> And therefore he adviseth us to be sober and
    watch: for the divell goeth about like a roring lion, seeking whome he
    may devoure. He meaneth not with carnall teeth:<span class="sni">Idem ibid.</span> for it followeth thus,
    Whome resist ye stedfastlie in faith. And againe he saith, That which
    is spirituall onelie discerneth spirituall things:<span class="sni">1. Cor. 2. 14.</span> for no carnall man
    can discerne the things of the spirit. Why then should we thinke that
    a divell, which is a spirit, can be knowne, or made tame and familiar
    unto a naturall man; or contrarie to nature, can be by a witch made
    corporall, being by God ordeined to a spirituall proportion?</p>

  <p>The cause of this grosse conceipt is, that we hearken more diligentlie
    to old wives, and rather give credit to their fables, than/<span class="snp" id="p_509"><i>509.</i></span> to the
    word of God; imagining by the tales they tell us, that the divell
    is such a bulbegger, as I have before described. For whatsoever is
    proposed in scripture to us by parable, or spoken figurativelie or
    significativelie, or framed to our grosse capacities, &amp;c: is by them
    so considered and expounded, as though the bare letter, or rather
    their grosse imaginations thereupon were to be preferred before the
    true sense and meaning of the word. For I dare saie, that when these
    blockheads read <i>Jothans</i> parable in the ninth of Judges to the men of
    <i>Sichem</i>;<span class="sni">Judg. 9. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</span> to wit, that the trees went out to annoint a king over them,
    saieng to the olive tree, Reigne thou over us: who answered and said,
    Should I leave my fatnesse, &amp;c? They imagine that the woodden trees
    walked, &amp; spake with a mans voice: or else, that some spirit entred
    into the trees, and answered as is imagined they did in the idols and

    of <i>David</i>, <i>&amp;c</i>: The spirit of grace and compassion. Againe, Ye have
    not received the spirit of bondage, but the spirit of adoption. And

    of great works; to another, the discerning of spirits; to another, the
    diversitie of toongs; to another, the interpretation of toongs: and all
    these things worketh one and the selfesame spirit. Thus farre the words
    of <i>Paule</i>.<span class="sni">Isai. 19, 14.</span> And finallie, <i>Esaie</i> saith, that the Lord mingled among

    you with a spirit of slumber.</p>

  <p>As for the spirits of divination spoken of in the scripture, they are
    such as was in the woman of <i>Endor</i>,<span class="sni">1. Sam. 28.<br />Hest. 16.</span> the <i>Philippian</i> woman, the wench
    of <i>Westwell</i>, and the holie maid of <i>Kent</i>; who were indued with

    a spirit or divell is to be understood spirituallie, and is neither a

    hir disease. Wherby it is to be seene, that although it be said, that
    sathan had bound hir, &amp;c: yet that it was a sicknes or disease of bodie
    that troubled hir; for Christs owne words expound it. Neither is there
    any word of witchcraft mentioned, which some saie was the cause thereof.</p>

  <p>There were seven divels cast out of <i>Marie Magdalen</i>.<span class="sni">Mark. 16, 9.</span> Which is not so
    grosselie understood by the learned, as that there were in hir just
    seven corporall divels, such as I described before elsewhere; but that
    by the number of seven divels, a great multitude, and an uncerteine
    number of vices is signified: which figure is usuall in divers places
    of the scripture.<span class="sni">Levit. 26.<br />Prov. 24.<br />Luk.
    17.</span> And this interpretation is more agreeable with Gods
    word, than the papisticall paraphrase, which is; that Christ, under
    the name of the seven divels, recounteth the seven deadlie sinnes
    onelie. Others allow neither of these expositions; bicause they suppose
    that the efficacie of Christs miracle should this waie be confounded:
    as though it were not as difficult a matter, with a touch to make a
    good Christian of a vicious person; as with a word to cure the ague,
    or any other disease of a sicke bodie.<span class="sni">Matth. 8, 16.</span> I thinke not but any of both
    these cures may be wrought by meanes, in processe of time, without
    miracle; the one by the preacher, the other by the physician. But I
    saie that Christs worke in both was apparentlie miraculous: for with
    power and authoritie, even with a touch of his finger, and a word of
    his mouth, he made the blind to see,<span class="sni">Luk. 4, 36.<br />Luk. 7, 21.</span> the halt to go, the lepers cleane,
    the deafe to heare, the dead to rise againe, and the poore to receive

    conformed them to become good Christians, which before were dissolute
    livers;<span class="sni">John 8, 11.</span> to whome he said, Go your waies and sinne no more./</p>

    witchmongers affirme) all these diseases mentioned in the scripture,
    and manie other more; as the gowt, the toothach, &amp;c: which we find not
    that ever Christ cured.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Mat. 4, 17, &amp;c.</span>As touching those that are said in the Gospell to be possessed of
    spirits, it seemeth in manie places that it is indifferent, or all
    one, to saie; He is possessed with a divell; or, He is lunatike
    or phrentike: which disease in these daies is said to proceed of
    melancholie. But if everie one that now is lunatike, be possessed with
    a reall divell; then might it be thought, that divels are to be thrust
    out of men by medicines. But who saith in these times with the woman of
    <i>Canaan</i>; My daughter is vexed with a divell, except it be presupposed,
    that she meant hir daughter was troubled with some disease? Indeed we
    saie, and saie truelie, to the wicked, The divell is in him: but we
    meane not thereby, that a reall divell is gotten into his guts. And if
    it were so, I marvell/<span class="snp" id="p_513"><i>513.</i></span> in what shape this reall divell, that possesseth
    them, remaineth. Entreth he into the bodie in one shape, and into the
    mind in another? If they grant him to be spirituall and invisible, I
    agree with them.</p>

  <p>Some are of opinion, that the said woman of <i>Chanaan</i> ment indeed that
    hir daughter was troubled with some disease; bicause it is written in
    sted of that the divell was cast out,<span class="sni">Matt. 15, 28.</span> that hir daughter was made whole,
    even the selfesame houre. According to that which is said in the 12.
    of <i>Matthew</i>;<span class="sni">Matt. 12, 22.</span> There was brought unto Christ one possessed of a divell,
    which was both blind and dumbe, and he healed
    him: so as, he that was blind and dumbe both spake and sawe.
    But it was the man, and not the divell, that was healed,
    and made to speake and see. Whereby (I saie) it is
    gathered, that such as were diseased, as well
    as they that were lunatike, were
    said sometimes to be
    possessed of
    divels.</p>

    ERE I cannot omit to shew, how fondlie diverse writers; and namelie,
    <i>James Sprenger</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Mal. malef. quæst. 5. pa. 1.</i></span> and <i>Henrie Institor</i> doo gather and note the cause,
    why the divell maketh choise to possesse men at certeine times of the
    moone; which is (saie they) in two respects: first, that they may
    defame so good a creature as the moone; secondly, bicause the braine
    is the moistest part of the bodie. The divell therefore considereth
    the aptnesse and conveniencie thereof (the *moone<span class="sni">* A maxime in philosophie, as the sunne <i>in aridis &amp; siccis</i>.</span> having dominion
    over all moist things) so as they take advantage therby, the better
    to bring their purposes to passe. And further they saie, that divels
    being conjured and called up, appeere and come sooner in some certeine
    constellations, than in other some: thereby to induce men to thinke,
    that there is some godhead in the starres. But when <i>Saule</i> was
    releeved with the sound of the harpe, they saie that the departure
    of the divell was/<span class="snp" id="p_514"><i>514.</i></span> by meanes of the signe of the crosse imprinted
    in <i>Davids</i> veines. Whereby we maie see how absurd the imaginations
    and de/vises<span class="snp"><b>369.</b></span> of men are, when they speake according to their owne
    fansies, without warrant of the word of God. But me thinks it is verie
    absurd that <i>Josephus</i><span class="sni"><i>Joseph. de antiquitat. Jud. item de bello Jud. lib. 7. ca. 35.</i></span> affirmeth; to wit, that the divell should be
    thrust out of anie man by vertue of a root. And as vaine it is, that
    <i>Ælianus</i> writeth of the magicall herbe <i>Cynospastus</i>, otherwise called
    <i>Agla[o]photis</i>; which is all one with <i>Salomons</i> root named <i>Baaros</i>,

    is the<span class="sni">Num. 27, 16.</span> Holie-ghost,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
    who is Lord of all spirits; alwaies considering,
    that evermore spirits are spoken of in scripture, as of things
    spirituall; though for the helpe of our capacities they are there
    sometimes more grosselie and corporallie expressed, either in parables
    or by metaphors, than indeed they are. <span class="sni">1. Reg. 18. verse.
    23. verse. 4.</span>As for example (and to omit the
    historie of <i>Job</i>, which elsewhere I handle) it is written; The Lord
    said, Who shall entise <i>Ahab</i>, that he maie fall at <i>Ramoth Gilead</i>,
    <i>&amp;c</i>? Then came foorth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said; I
    will entise him. And the Lord said, Wherewith? And he said; I will go
    and be a lieng spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. Then he said;
    Go foorth, thou shalt prevaile, &amp;c./</p>

  <p><span class="snp" id="p_515"><i>515.</i></span>This storie is here set foorth in this wise, to beare with our
    capacities, and speciallie with the capacitie of that age, that could
    not otherwise conceive of spirituall things, than by such corporall
    demonstrations. And yet here is to be noted, that one spirit, and not
    manie or diverse, did possesse all the false prophets at once. Even as
    in another place,<span class="sni">Luke. 8. 27. 28.<br />Mark. 5. 9.<br />Luk. 8.</span>
    manie thousand divels are said to possesse one man:
    and yet it is also said even in the selfe same place, that the same man
    was possessed onelie with one divell. For it is there said that Christ
    met a man, which had a divell, and he commanded the fowle spirit to
    come foorth of the man, &amp;c. But <i>Calvine</i><span class="sni"><i>J. Cal. lib. instit. lib. 1. cap. 14. sect. 14.</i></span> saith; Where sathan or the
    divell is named in the singular number, thereby is meant that power of
    wickednesse, that standeth against the kingdome of justice. And where
    manie divels are named in the scriptures, we are thereby taught, that
    we must fight with an infinite multitude of enimies; least despising
    the fewnesse of them, we should be more slacke to enter into battell,
    and so fall into securitie and idlenes.</p>

  <p>On the other side, it is as plainelie set downe in the scripture,
    that some/<span class="snp"><b>370.</b></span> are possessed with the spirit of God, as that the other
    are endued and bound with the spirit of the divell. Yea sometimes we
    read, that one good spirit was put into a great number of persons;<span class="sni">Num. 11.</span>
    and againe, that diverse spirits rested in and upon one man: and yet
    no reall or corporall spirit meant. As for example; The Lord tooke of
    the spirit that was upon <i>Moses</i>,<span class="sni">Ibid. vers. 25</span> and put it upon the seventie elders,
    and when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. Why should not
    this be as substantiall and corporall a spirit, as that, wherewith
    the maid in the <i>Acts</i><span class="sni">Acts. 16.<br />2. Reg. 2.<br />Judg. 3. 10.</span> of the apostles was possessed? Also <i>Elisha</i>
    intreated <i>Elia</i>, that when he departed, his spirit might double upon
    him. We read also that the spirit of the Lord came upon <sup>a</sup><i>Othniel</i>,<span class="sni"><sup>a</sup> Judg. 11. 39.</span>

    than another sort, which hold, that such bodies are made to their
    hands. Howbeit, these doo varie in the elements, wherewith these
    spirituall bodies are composed. For (as I have said) some affirme that
    they consist of fier, some thinke of aier, and some of the starres and
    other celestiall powers. But if they be celestiall, then (as <i>Peter
    Martyr</i> saith) must they follow the circular motion: and if they be
    elementarie,<span class="sni">For everie naturall motion is either circular or elemētarie.</span> then must they follow the motions of those elements, of
    which their bodies consist. Of aier they cannot be: for aier is <i>Corpus

    no distinct members made. For an organicall bodie must have bones,
    sinewes, veines, flesh, &amp;c: which cannot be made of aier. Neither (as
    <i>Peter Martyr</i> affirmeth) can an aierie bodie receive or have either
    shape or figure.

    ANIE affirme (upon a fable cited by <i>M. Mal.</i>) that spirits are of
    aier, bicause they have beene cut (as he saith) in sunder, and closed
    presentlie againe; and also bicause they vanish awaie so suddenlie.
    But of such apparitions I have alreadie spoken, and am shortlie to
    saie more, which are rather seene in the imagination of the weake and
    diseased, than in veritie and truth. Which sights and apparitions,
    as they have beene common among the unfaithfull; so now, since the
    preaching of the gospell they are most rare. And as among faintharted
    people; namelie, women, children, and sicke folkes, they usuallie
    swarmed: so among strong bodies and good stomachs they never used to
    appeare; as elsewhere I have prooved: which argueth that they were
    onelie phantasticall and imaginarie. Now saie they that imagine divels
    and spirits to be made of aier, that it must needs be that they consist
    of that element; bicause otherwise when they vanish suddenlie awaie,
    they should leave some earthie substance behind them. If they were of
    water, then should they moisten the place where they stand, and must
    needs be shed on the floore. If they consisted of fier, then would they
    burne anie thing that touched them: and yet (saie they) <i>Abraham</i> and
    <i>Lot</i><span class="sni">Gen. 18, 19.</span> washed their feete, and were neither scalded nor burnt.</p>

  <p>I find it not in the Bible, but in <i>Bodin</i>,<span class="sni"><i>J. Bod.
    lib. de dæm. 3. ca. 4.</i></span> that there are daie divels,
    and night divels. The same fellow saith, that <i>Deber</i> is the name of
    that divell, which hurteth by night; and <i>Cheleb</i> is he that hurteth
    by daie: howbeit, he confesseth that Sathan can hurt both by daie and
    by night; although it be certeine (as he saith) that he can doo more
    harme by night than by daie; producing for example, how in a night
    he slew the first borne of <i>Ægypt</i>./<span class="snp" id="p_518"><i>518.</i></span> And yet it appeareth plainelie
    in the text, that the Lord himselfe did it.<span class="sni">Exod. 12 29.</span> Whereby it seemeth, that
    <i>Bodin</i> putteth no difference betweene God and the divell. For further
    confirmation of this his foolish assertion, that divels are more
    valiant by night than by daie, he alledgeth the 104. <i>Psalme</i>,<span class="sni">Psa. 104. 20.</span> wherein
    is written, Thou makest darknesse, and it is night, wherein all the
    beasts of the forrest creepe foorth, the lions rore, &amp;c: when the sunne
    riseth, they retire, &amp;c. So as now he maketh all beasts to be divels,
    or divels to be beasts. Oh barbarous blindnes! This <i>Bodin</i>
    <span class="sni"><i>J. Bod. lib. de dæm. 3. ca. 5.</i></span>

    abusing the scriptures,<span class="sni">Levit. 1.</span> which he is not ashamed to quote in that

  <p>Sometimes also we find in the scriptures, that divels and spirits take
    their names of wicked men, or of the houses or stats of abhominable

    commandement, and was also worshipped of <i>Salomon</i>. Which though
    it signifie riches, flocks, &amp;c: yet it was once a citie belonging
    to <i>Og</i> the king of <i>Basan</i>, where they saie the giants dwelt. In
    these respects <i>Astaroth</i> is one of the speciall divels named in
    <i>Salomons</i> conjuration, and greatlie emploied by the conjurors. I have
    sufficientlie prooved in these quotations, that these idols are <i>Dii
    gentium</i>, the gods of the Gentiles: and then the prophet <i>David</i> may
    satisfie you, that they are divels, who saith <i>Dii gentium dæmonia
    sunt</i>,<span class="sni">Psal. 96. [Vulg. vers.]</span> The gods of the Gentiles are divels. What a divell was the rood

    ND<span class="sni">Psalm. 96.</span> for so much as the idols of the gentiles are called divels, and
    are among the unlearned confounded and intermedled with the divels
    that are named in the scriptures; I thought it convenient here to give
    you a note of them, to whome the Gentiles gave names, according to the
    offices unto them assigned. <i>Penates</i><span class="sni">Juno and Minerva.</span> are the domesticall gods, or
    rather divels/<span class="snp"><b>374.</b></span> that were said to make men live quietlie within doores.
    But some thinke these rather to be such, as the Gentiles thought to
    be set over kingdomes: and that <i>Lares</i> are such as trouble private
    houses, and are set to oversee crosse waies and cities. <i>Larvæ</i> are
    said to be spirits that walke onelie by night. <i>Genii</i> are the two
    angels, which they supposed were appointed to wait upon each man.
    <i>Manes</i> are the spirits which oppose themselves against men in the
    waie. <i>Dæmones</i> were feigned gods by poets, as <i>Jupiter</i>, <i>Juno</i>, &amp;c.
    <i>Virunculi terrei</i><span class="sni">Cousening gods or knaves.</span>
    are such as was Robin good fellowe, that would
    supplie the office of servants, speciallie of maids; as to make a
    fier in the morning, sweepe the house, grind mustard and malt, drawe
    water, &amp;c: these also rumble in houses, drawe latches, go up and downe
    staiers, &amp;c. <i>Dii geniales</i><span class="sni"><i>Terra, aqua, aer, ignis,
    sol, &amp; Luna.</i></span> are the gods that everie man did sacrifice
    unto at the daie of their birth. <i>Tetrici</i> be they that make folke
    afraid, and have such ouglie shape, which manie of our divines
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span> doo
    call <i>Subterranei</i>. <i>Cobali</i> are they that followe men, and delight
    to make them laugh, with tumbling, juggling, and such like toies.
    <i>Virunculi</i> are dwarfes about three handfulles long, and doo no hurt;
    but seeme to dig in mineralles, and to be verie busie, and yet doo
    nothing. <i>Guteli</i> or <i>Trulli</i><span class="snp" id="p_522"><i>522.</i></span> are spirits (they saie) in the likenes
    of women, shewing great kind/nesse to all men: &amp; hereof it is that we
    call light women, truls. <i>Dæmones montani</i> are such as worke in the
    mineralles, and further the worke of the labourers woonderfullie, who
    are nothing afraid of them. <i>Hudgin</i><span class="sni">
    *Hudgin<span class="sni">[* Hutgin, <i>Wier</i>.]</span> of Germanie,
    and Rush of England.</span> is a verie familiar divell, which
    will doo no bodie hurt, except he receive injurie: but he cannot abide
    that, nor yet be mocked: he talketh with men freendlie, sometimes
    visiblie, and sometimes invisiblie. There go as manie tales upon this
    <i>Hudgin</i>, in some parts of <i>Germanie</i>, as there did in <i>England</i>
    of Robin good fellowe. But this <i>Hudgin</i> was so called, bicause he
    alwaies ware a cap or a hood†;<span class="sni">[† See note.]</span> and therefore I thinke it was
    Robin hood. Frier <i>Rush</i> was for all the world such another fellow as
    this <i>Hudgin</i>, and brought up even in the same schoole; to wit, in a
    kitchen: in so much as the selfe-same tale is written of the one as of
    the other, concerning the skullian, which is said to have beene slaine,
    &amp;c: for the reading whereof I referre you to Frier <i>Rush</i> his storie,
    or else to <i>John Wierus De præstigiis dæmonum</i>.<span class="sni"><i>J. Wier. lib. de præst. dæm. 1. cap. 23.</i></span></p>

  <p>There were also <i>Familiares dæmones</i>, which we call familiars: such
    as <i>Socrates</i> and <i>Cæsar</i> were said to have; and such as <i>Feats</i> sold
    to doctor <i>Burcot</i>. <i>Quintus Sertorius</i> had <i>Diana</i> hir selfe for his
    familiar; and <i>Numa Pompilius</i> had <i>Aegeria</i>: but neither the one nor
    the other of all these could be preserved by their familiars from being
    destroied with untimelie death. <i>Simon Samareus</i> boasted, that he had
    gotten by conjuration, the soule of a little child that was slaine, to
    be his familiar, and that he told him all things that were to come,
    &amp;c. I marvell what privilege soules have, which are departed from the
    bodie, to know things to come more than the soules within mans bodie.
    There were spirits, which they called <i>Albæ mulieres</i>, and <i>Albæ
      Silyllæ</i>, which were verie familiar, and did much harme (they saie)
    to women with child, and to sucking children. <i>Deumus</i> as a divell is
    worshipped among the <i>Indians</i> in <i>Calecute</i>, who (as they thinke) hath
    power given him of God to judge the earth, &amp;c: his image is horriblie
    pictured in a most ouglie shape. <i>Thevet</i> saith, that a divell/<span class="snp"><b>375.</b></span> in

    groveling like a lecherous knave. There are a thousand other names,

  <p class="subheadc"><i>Of the Romanes cheefe gods called Dii selecti, and of other

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_t.png" width="75" height="75" alt='T' /></span>HERE
    were among the <i>Romans</i> twentie idolatrous gods, which were
    called <i>Dii selecti sive electi</i>, chosen gods; whereof twelve were
    male, and eight female, whose names doo thus followe: <i>Janus</i>,
    <i>Saturnus</i>, <i>Jupiter</i>, <i>Genius</i>, <i>Mercurius</i>, <i>Apollo</i>, <i>Mars</i>,
    <i>Vulcanus</i>, <i>Neptunus</i>, <i>Sol</i>, <i>Orcus</i> and *<i>Vibar</i>,<span class="sni">[* <i>Liber</i>]</span> which were
    all hee gods: <i>Tellus</i>, <i>Ceres</i>, <i>Juno</i>, <i>Minerva</i>, <i>Luna</i>, <i>Diana</i>,
    <i>Venus</i>, and <i>Vesta</i>, were all she gods. No man might appropriate anie
    of these unto himselfe, but they were left common and indifferent to
    all men dwelling in one realme, province, or notable citie. These
    heathen gentiles had also their gods, which served for sundrie
    purposes; as to raise thunder, they had <i>Statores</i>, <i>Tonantes</i>,
    <i>Feretrii</i>, and <i>Jupiter Elicius</i>. They had <i>Cantius</i>,<span class="sni">A good god and goddesse for women.</span> to whome they
    praied for wise children, who was more apt for this purpose than
    <i>Minerva</i> that issued out of <i>Jupiters</i> owne braine. <i>Lucina</i> was to
    send them that were with child safe deliverie, and in that respect was
    called the mother of childwives. <i>Opis</i> was called the mother of the
    babe new borne, whose image women with child hanged upon their girdles
    before their bellies, and bare it so by/<span class="snp" id="p_524"><i>524.</i></span> the space of nine moneths; and
    the midwife alwaies touched the child therewith, before she or anie
    other laied hand thereon.</p>

  <p>If the child were well borne, they sacrificed therunto, although the
    mother miscaried: but if the child were in any part unperfect, or dead,
    &amp;c: they used to beate the image into powder, or to burne or drowne it.
    <i>Vagianus</i><span class="sni">The names of certeine heathenish gods, and their peculiar
    offices.</span> was he that kept their children from crieng, and therefore
    they did alwaies hang his picture about babes necks: for they thought
    much crieng in youth portended ill fortune in age. <i>Cuninus</i>, otherwise
    <i>Cunius</i>, was he that preserved (as they thought)
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>their children from
    misfortune in the cradell. <i>Ruminus</i> was to keepe their dugs from
    corruption. <i>Volumnus</i> and his wife <i>Volumna</i> were gods, the one for
    yoong men, the other for/<span class="snp"><b>376.</b></span> maids that desired marriage: for such as
    praied devoutlie unto them, should soone be married. <i>Agrestis</i> was the
    god of the fields, and to him they praied for fertilitie. <i>Bellus</i> was
    the god of warre &amp; warriers, and so also was <i>Victoria</i>, to whome the
    greatest temple in <i>Rome</i> was built. <i>Honorius</i> was he that had charge
    about inkeepers, that they should well intreat pilgrimes. <i>Berecynthia</i>
    was the mother of all the gods. <i>Aesculanus</i> was to discover their
    mines of gold and silver, and to him they praied for good successe
    in that behalfe. <i>Aesculapius</i> was to cure the sicke, whose father
    was <i>Apollo</i>, and served to keepe weeds out of the corne. <i>Segacia</i>
    was to make seeds to growe. <i>Flora</i> preserved the vines from frosts
    and blasts. <i>Sylvanus</i> was to preserve them that walked in gardens.
    <i>Bacchus</i> was for droonkards, <i>Pavor</i> for cowherds; <i>Meretrix</i> for
    whores, to whose honour there was a temple built in <i>Rome</i>, in the
    middest of fortie and foure streets, which were all inhabited with
    common harlots. Finallie <i>Colatina</i>, *<span class="sni">[* <i>alias</i> Ital.]</span><i>alias Clotina</i>, was goddesse
    of the stoole, the jakes, and the privie, to whome as to everie of the

    if I thought I could make an end in anie reasonable time, I would
    begin with our antichristian gods, otherwise called popish idols, which
    are as ranke divels as <i>Dii gentium</i><span class="sni">1. Reg. 20.<br />2. Chr. 32.<br />1. Chr. 16.<br />Judg. 3.<br />2. Chr. 33.<br />
    2. Reg. 23, &amp;c.</span> spoken of in the psalmes: or as
    <i>Dii montium</i> set foorth &amp; rehearsed in the first booke of the kings;
    or as <i>Dii</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
    <i>terrarum</i> or <i>Dii populorum</i> mentioned in the second of
    the Chronicles 32. &amp; in the first of the Chronicles 16. or as <i>Dii
    terræ</i> in Judges 3. or as <i>Dii filiorum Seir</i> in the second of the
    Chronicles 25. or as <i>Dii alieni</i>, which are so often mentioned in the
    scriptures.</p>

  <p>Surelie, there were in the popish church more of these in number, more
    in common, more private, more publike, more for lewd purposes, and
    more for no purpose, than among all the heathen, either heretofore, or
    at this present time: for I dare undertake,/<span class="snp" id="p_527"><i>527.</i></span> that for everie heathen
    idoll I might produce twentie out of the popish church.<span class="sni">Popish gods of nations.</span> For there
    were proper idols of everie nation: as S. <i>George</i> on horssebacke for
    <i>England</i> (excepting whome there is said to be no more horssemen in
    heaven save onelie saint <i>Martine</i>) S. <i>Andrew</i> for <i>Burgundie</i> and
    <i>Scotland</i>, S. <i>Michael</i> for <i>France</i>, S. <i>James</i> for <i>Spaine</i>, S.
    <i>Patrike</i> for <i>Ireland</i>, S. <i>Davie</i> for <i>Wales</i>, S. <i>Peter</i> for <i>Rome</i>,
    and some part of <i>Italie</i>. Had not everie citie in all the popes
    dominions his severall patrone? As <i>Paule</i> for <i>London</i>, <i>Denis</i> for
    <i>Paris</i>, <i>Ambrose</i> for <i>Millen</i>, <i>Loven</i> for <i>Gaunt</i>, <i>Romball</i> for
    <i>Mackline</i>, S. <i>Marks</i> lion for <i>Venice</i>, the three magician kings for
    <i>Cullen</i>,*<span class="sni">[* = Cologne]</span>
    and so of other./<span class="snp"><b>378.</b></span> Yea, had they not for everie small
    towne,<span class="sni">Parish gods or popish idols</span> and everie village and parish,†
    <span class="sni">[† . in text]</span> (the names wherof I am not
    at leisure to repeat) a severall idoll? As S. <i>Sepulchre</i>, for one; S.
    <i>Bride</i>, for another; S. All halowes, All saints, and our Ladie for all
    at once: which I thought meeter to rehearse, than a bedroll‡<span class="sni">[‡ = bead—]</span> of
    such a number as are in that predicament. Had they not hee idols and
    shee idols, some for men, some for women, some for beasts, and some
    for fowles, &amp;c? Doo you not thinke that S. <i>Martine</i> might be opposed
    to <i>Bacchus</i>? If S. <i>Martine</i> be too weake we have S. <i>Urbane</i>, S.
    <i>Clement</i>, and manie other to assist him. Was <i>Venus</i> and <i>Meretrix</i>
    an advocate for whoores among the Gentiles? Behold, there were in the
    Romish church to encounter with them, S. <i>Aphra</i>, S. <i>Aphrodite</i>, and
    S. <i>Maudline</i>. But insomuch as long <i>Meg</i> was as verie a whoore as the
    best of them, she had wrong that she was not also canonized, and put
    in as good credit as they: for she was a gentlewoman borne; whereunto
    the pope hath great respect in canonizing of his saints. For (as I
    have said) he canonizeth the rich for saints, and burneth the poore
    for witches. But I doubt not, <i>Magdalen</i>, and manie other godlie women
    are verie saints in heaven, and should have beene so, though the pope
    had never canonized them: but he dooth them wrong, to make them the
    patronesses of harlots and strong strumpets.</p>

  <p>Was there such a traitor among all the heathen idols,<span class="sni">See
    the golden Legend for the life of S. Bridget.</span> as S. <i>Thomas
    Becket</i>? Or such a whoore as S. <i>Bridget</i>? I warrant you S. <i>Hugh</i> was
    as good a huntesman as <i>Anubis</i>. Was <i>Vulcane</i> the protector of the
    heathen smithes? Yea forsooth, and S. <i>Euloge</i> was patrone for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>ours.
    Our painters had <i>Luke</i>, our weavers/<span class="snp" id="p_528"><i>528.</i></span> had <i>Steven</i>,<span class="sni">He saints &amp; shee saincts of the old stamp with their

    <i>Arnold</i>, our tailors had <i>Goodman</i>, our sowters had <i>Crispine</i>, our
    potters had S. <i>Gore</i> with a divell on his shoulder and a pot in his
    hand. Was there a better horseleech among the gods of the Gentiles
    than S. <i>Loy</i>? Or a better sowgelder than S. <i>Anthonie</i>? Or a better
    toothdrawer than S. <i>Apolline</i>? I beleeve that <i>Apollo Parnopeius</i> was
    no better a ratcatcher than S. <i>Gertrude</i>, who hath the popes patent
    and commendation therefore. The <i>Thebans</i> had not a better shepherd
    than S. <i>Wendeline</i>, nor a better gissard to keepe their geese than
    <i>Gallus</i>. But for physicke and surgerie, our idols exceeded them all.
    For S. <i>John</i>, and S. <i>Valentine</i> excelled at the falling evill, S.
    <i>Roch</i> was good at the plague, S. <i>Petronill</i> at the ague. As for S.
    <i>Margaret</i>, she passed <i>Lucina</i> for a midwife, and yet was but a maid:
    in which respect S. <i>Marpurge</i> is joined with hir in commission.</p>

  <p>For mad men, and such as are possessed with divels, S. <i>Romane</i> was
    excellent, &amp; frier <i>Ruffine</i> was also pretilie skilfull in that art.
    For botches and biles, <i>Cosmus</i> and <i>Damian</i>; S. <i>Clare</i> for the eies,
    S. <i>Apolline</i> for teeth, S. <i>Job</i> for the *pox.<span class="sni">*
    For the Frēch pox or the cōmon kind of pox, or both? This would be knowne.</span> And for sore brests
    S. <i>Agatha</i> was as good as <i>Ruminus</i>. Whosoever served <i>Servatius</i>
    well, should be sure to loose nothing: if <i>Servatius</i> failed in his
    office, S. <i>Vinden</i> could supplie the matter with his cunning; for
    he could cause all things that were lost to be restored againe. But
    here laie a strawe for a while, and I will shew you the names of some,
    which exceed these verie far, and might have beene canonized for
    archsaints; all the other saints or idols being in comparison of them
    but bunglers, and bench-whistlers. And with your leave, when all/<span class="snp"><b>379.</b></span> other
    saints had given over the matter, and the saints utterlie forsaken of
    their servitors, they repaired to these that I shall name unto you,
    with the good consent of the pope, who is the fautor, or rather the
    patrone of all the saints, divels, and idols living or dead, and of all
    the gods save one. And whereas none other saint could cure above one
    disease, in so much as it was idolatrie, follie I should have said,
    to go to <i>Job</i> for anie other maladie than the pox; nothing commeth
    amisse to these. For they are good at anie thing, and never a-whit
    nice of their cunning: yea greater matters are said to be in one of
    their powers, than is in all the other saints. And these are they: S.
    mo/ther<span class="snp" id="p_529"><i>529.</i></span> <i>Bungie</i>, S. mother <i>Paine</i>,

    bicause I know, that the papists will saie, that their idols are
    saints, and no such divels as the gods of the Gentiles were: you may
    tell them, that not onelie their saints, but the verie images of
    them were called <i>Divi</i>.<span class="sni"><i>Divos vocant Grammatici eos qui ex hominibus dii facti
    sunt.</i></span> Which though it signifie gods, and so by
    consequence idols or feends: yet put but an (<i>ll</i>) thereunto, and it is
    <i>Divill</i> in English. But they will saie also that I doo them wrong to
    gibe at them; bicause they were holie men and holie women. I grant some
    of them were so, and further from allowance of the popish idolatrie
    emploied upon them, than greeved with the derision used against that
    abuse. Yea even as silver and gold are made idols unto them that love
    them too well, and seeke too much for them: so are these holie men and
    women made idols by them that worship them, and attribute unto them
    such honor, as to God onelie apperteineth.</p>

  <p>The heathen gods were for the most part good men, and profitable
    members to the commonwealth wherein they lived, and deserved fame, &amp;c:
    in which respect they made gods of them when they were dead; as they
    made divels of such emperors and philosophers as they hated, or as had
    deserved ill among them. And is it not even so, and woorsse, in the
    commonwealth and church of poperie? Dooth not the pope excommunicate,
    cursse, and condemne for heretikes, and drive to the bottomlesse pit
    of hell, proclaming to be verie divels, all those that either write,
    speake or thinke contrarie to his idolatrous doctrine? <i>Cicero</i>, when
    he de/rided<span class="snp" id="p_530"><i>530.</i></span> the heathen gods,
    <span class="sni"><i>Cic. de natur. deorum.</i></span>and inveied against them that yeelded
    such servile honor unto them, knew the persons, unto whom such abuse
    was committed, had well deserved as civill citizens; and that good fame
    was due unto them, and not divine estimation. Yea the infidels that
    honored those gods, as hoping to receive benefits for their devotion
    emploied that waie, knew and conceived that the statues and images,
    before whome with such reverence/<span class="snp"><b>380.</b></span> they powred foorth their praiers,
    were stockes and stones, and onelie pictures of those persons whome
    they resembled: yea they also knew, that the parties themselves were
    creatures, and could not doo so much as the <span class="sni">The papists see a moth in the eie of others, but no beame in
    their owne.</span>papists and witchmongers
    thinke the Roode of grace, or mother <i>Bungie</i> could doo. And yet the
    papists can see the abuse of the Gentils, and may not heare of their
    owne idolatrie more grosse and damnable than the others.</p>

    papists perchance will denie, that they attribute so much to these
    idols as I report; or that they thinke it so meritorious to praie
    to the images of saints as is supposed, affirming that they worship
    God, and the saints themselves, under the formes of images. Which was
    also the conceipt of the heathen, and their excuse in this behalfe;
    whose eiesight and insight herein reached as farre as the papisticall
    distinctions published by popes and their councels. Neither doo anie of
    them admit so grosse idolatrie, as the councell of <i>Trent</i><span class="sni">The idolatrous councell of Trent.</span> hath doone,
    who alloweth that worship to the Rood that is due to Jesus Christ
    himselfe, and so likewise of other images of saints. I thought it not
    impertinent therfore in this place to insert an example taken out of
    the Rosarie of our Ladie, in which booke doo remaine (besides this)
    ninetie and eight examples to this effect: which are of such authoritie
    in/<span class="snp" id="p_531"><i>531.</i></span> the church of <i>Rome</i>, that all scripture must give place unto
    them. And these are either read there as their speciall homilies, or
    preached by their cheefe doctors. And this is the sermon for this daie
    verbatim translated out of the said Rosarie, a booke much esteemed and
    reverenced among papists.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Exempl. 4.</i></span>A certeine hangman passing by the image of our Ladie, saluted hir,
    commending himselfe to hir protection. Afterwards, while he praied
    before hir, he was called awaie to hang an offendor: but his enimies
    intercepted him, and slew him by the waie. And lo a certeine holie
    preest, which nightlie walked about everie church in the citie, rose
    up that night, and was going to his ladie, I should saie to our ladie
    church. And in the churchyard he saw a great manie dead men, and
    some of them he knew, of whome he asked what the matter was, &amp;c. Who
    answered, that the hangman was slaine, and the divell challenged his
    soule, the which our ladie said was hirs: and the judge was even at
    hand comming thither to heare the cause, &amp; therefore (said they) we
    are now come togither. The preest thought he would be at the hearing
    hereof, and hid himselfe<span class="sni">But our ladie spied him well
    enough: as you shal read.</span> behind a tree; and anon he saw the judiciall
    seat readie prepared and furnished, where the judge, to wit Jesus

    brought in the hangman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
    pinnioned, and prooved by good evidence, that
    his soule belonged to them. On the/<span class="snp"><b>381.</b></span> other side, our ladie pleaded for
    the hangman, prooving that he, at the houre of death, commended his
    soule to hir. The judge hearing the matter so well debated on either
    side, but willing to obeie (for these are his words) his mothers
    desire, and loath to doo the divels anie wrong, gave sentence, that
    the hangmans soule should returne to his bodie, untill he had made
    sufficient satisfaction; ordeining that the pope should set foorth a
    publike forme of praier for the hangmans soule. It was demanded, who
    should doo the arrand to the popes holines? Marie quoth our ladie, that
    shall yonder preest that lurketh behind the tree.<span class="sni">The preests arse made buttons.</span> The preest being
    called foorth, and injoined to make relation hereof, and to desire the
    pope to take the paines to doo according to this decree, asked by what
    token he should be directed. Then was delivered unto him a rose of such
    beautie, as when the pope saw it, he knew his message was true. And so,
    if they doo not well, I praie God we may./</p>

    for one point of courtesie used to our ladie, having not one dramme
    of faith, repentance, nor yet of honestie in him. Neverthelesse, so
    credulous is the nature of man, as to beleeve this and such like
    fables: yea, to discredit such stuffe, is thought among the papists
    flat heresie. And though we that are protestants will not beleeve these
    toies, being so apparentlie popish: yet we credit and report other
    appearances, and assuming of bodies by soules and spirits; though they
    be as prophane, absurd, and impious as the other. We are sure the holie
    maide of <i>Kents</i> vision was a verie cousenage: but we can credit,
    imprint, and publish for a true possession or historie, the knaverie

    and release by trentals and masses said by a popish preest, &amp;c: and yet
    they in probabilitie are equall, and in number farre exceed the other.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Micha. And. thes. 151.</i></span>We thinke that to be a lie, which is written, or rather fathered upon

    this sermon went to his house, and told his sonne that he would fetch
    him awaie after a daie or twaine: as the papists saie he did in deed,
    although they lie in everie point thereof most maliciouslie. But we can
    beleeve <i>Platina</i> and others, when they tell us of the appearances of
    pope <i>Benedict</i> the eight, and also the ninth; how the one rode upon a
    blacke horsse in the wildernesse, requiring a bishop (as I remember)
    whome he met, that he would distribute certeine monie for him, which he
    had purloined of that which was given in almes to the poore, &amp;c: and
    how the other was seene a hundred yeares after the divell had killed
    him in a wood, of an heremite, in a beares skinne, and an asses head on

    that the <i>Pontamian</i> virgine, <i>Origins</i> disciple, appeared to S.

    will give credit unto such shamefull fables, or anie like them, when
    they find them written in the Legendarie, Festivall, Rosaries of our
    Ladie, or anie other such popish authors. Whereby I gather, that if the
    protestant beleeve some few lies, the papists beleeve a great number.
    This I write, to shew the imperfection of man, how attentive our eares
    are to hearken to tales. And though herein consist no great point
    of faith or infidelitie; yet let us that professe the gospell take

    And first you shall understand, that they hold, that all the soules in
    heaven may come downe and appeare to us when they list, and assume anie
    bodie saving their owne: otherwise (saie they) such soules should not
    be perfectlie happie.<span class="sni"><i>Idem thes. 235. &amp;. 136.</i></span> They saie that you may know the good soules from
    the bad verie easilie. For a damned soule hath a verie heavie and sowre
    looke; but a saints soule hath a cheerefull and a merrie countenance:
    these also are white/<span class="snp" id="p_535"><i>535.</i></span> and shining, the other cole blacke. And these
    damned soules also maie come up out of hell at their pleasure; although
    <i>Abraham</i><span class="sni"><i>Idem thes. 226.</i></span>
    made <i>Dives</i><span class="sni"><i>Th. Aq. 1. pa. quæ. 89. ar. 8.</i></span>
    beleeve the contrarie. They affirme that damned
    soules walke oftenest: next unto them the soules of purgatorie; and
    most seldome the soules of saints. Also they saie that in the old lawe
    soules did <span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
    appeare seldome; and after doomes daie<span class="sni"><i>Gregor. in dial. 4.</i></span> they shall never
    be seene more: in the time of grace they shall be most frequent. The
    walking of these soules (saith <i>Michael Andr.</i>)<span class="sni"><i>Mich. And. thes. 313. 316. 317.</i></span> is a most excellent
    argument for the proofe of purgatorie: for (saith he) those soules have
    testified that which the popes have affirmed in that behalfe; to wit,
    that there is not onelie such a place of punishment, but that they are
    released from thence by masses, and such other satisfactorie works;
    whereby the goodnes of the masse is also ratified and confirmed.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Idem thes. 346.</i></span>These heavenlie or purgatorie soules (saie they) appeare most commonlie

    Also they saie, that soules appeare oftenest by night; bicause men
    may then be at best leasure,<span class="sni"><i>Mich. Andr. thes. 345.</i></span> and most quiet. Also they never appeare

  <h3>The xxix. Chapter.</h3>

  <p class="subheadc"><i>A confutation of assuming of bodies, and of the serpent that seduced Eve.</i></p>

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_t.png" width="75" height="75" alt='T' /></span>HEY
    that contend so earnestlie for the divels assuming of bodies
    and visible shapes, doo thinke they have a great advantage by the
    words uttered in the third of <i>Genesis</i>,<span class="sni">Gen 3. 14. 15.</span> where they saie, the divell
    entered into a serpent or snake: and that by the cursse it appeareth,
    that the whole displeasure of God lighted upon the poore snake onlie.
    How those words are to be considered may appeare, in that it is of
    purpose so spoken, as our weake capacities may thereby best conceive
    the substance, tenor, and true meaning of the word, which is there set
    downe in the manner of a tragedie, in such humane and sensible forme,
    as woonderfullie informeth our understanding; though it seeme contrarie
    to the spirituall course of spirits and divels, and also to the nature
    and divinitie of God himselfe; who is infinite, and whome no man ever
    sawe with corporall eies, and lived. And doubtles, if the serpent there
    had not beene taken absolutelie, nor metaphoricallie for the divell,
    the Holie-ghost would have informed us thereof in some part of that
    storie. But to affirme it sometimes to be a divell, and sometimes a
    snake; whereas there is no such distinction to be found or seene in the
    text, is an invention and a fetch (me thinks) beyond the compasse of
    all divinitie. <span class="sni">Gen. 3. 1.<br />1. Cor. 11. 3.</span>
    Certeinlie the serpent was he that seduced <i>Eve</i>: now
    whether it were the divell, or a snake; let anie wise man (or rather
    let the word of God) judge. Doubtles the scripture in manie places
    expoundeth it to be the divell. And I have (I am sure) one wiseman on
    my side/<span class="snp" id="p_537"><i>537.</i></span> for the interpretation hereof,
    namelie <i>Salomon</i>;<span class="sni">Sap. 2, 24.</span> who saith,
    Through envie*<span class="sni">[* = hatred]</span> of the divell came death into the world: referring
    that to the divell, which <i>Moses</i> in the letter did to the serpent. But
    a better expositor hereof needeth not, than the text it selfe, even in
    the same place, where it is written; I will put enmitie betweene thee
    and the woman, and betweene thy seed and hir seed: he shall breake
    thy head, and thou shalt bruse his heele. What christian knoweth not,
    that in these words the mysterie of/<span class="snp"><b>385.</b></span> our redemption is comprised and
    promised? Wherein is not meant (as manie suppose) that the common seed
    of woman shall tread upon a snakes head, and so breake it in peeces,
    &amp;c: but that speciall seed, which is Christ, should be borne of a
    woman, to the utter overthrow of sathan, and to the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>redemption of
    mankind, whose heele or flesh in his members the divell should bruse
    and assault, with continuall attempts, and carnall provocations, &amp;c.</p>

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_t.png" width="75" height="75" alt='T' /></span>HIS
    word Serpent in holie scripture is taken for the divell:<span class="sni">Gen. 3, 1.</span> The
    serpent was more subtill than all the beasts of the feeld. It likewise
    signifieth such as be evill speakers, such as have slandering toongs,
    also heretiks, &amp;c: They have sharpned their toongs like serpents.<span class="sni">Psal. 139, 4.</span> It
    dooth likewise betoken the death and sacrifice of Christ: As <i>Moses</i>
    <span class="sni">Num. 8. &amp; 9.<br />John. 3, 14.</span>
    lifted up the serpent in the wildernesse, so must the sonne of man be
    lifted up upon the crosse. Moreover, it is taken for wicked men: O yee
    serpents and generation of vipers.<span class="sni">Matt. 23, 33.</span> Thereby also is signified as well
    wise as a subtile man: and in that sense did Christ himselfe use it;
    saieng, Be ye wise as serpents, &amp;c.<span class="sni">Matt. 10, 16.</span> So that by this breefe collection
    you see, that the word serpent, as it is equivocall, so likewise it
    is sometimes taken in the good and sometimes in the evill part. But
    where it is said, that the serpent was father of lies, author of death,
    and the worker of deceipt: me/<span class="snp" id="p_538"><i>538.</i></span> thinks it is a ridiculous opinion to
    hold, that thereby a snake is meant; which must be, if the letter be
    preferred before the allegorie. Trulie <i>Calvines</i><span class="sni"><i>J.
    Cal. in Genes. cap. 3. 1.</i></span> opinion is to be
    liked and reverenced, and his example to be embraced and followed, in
    that he offereth to subscribe to them that hold, that the Holie-ghost
    in that place did of purpose use obscure figures, that the cleare
    light thereof might be deferred, till Christs comming.<span class="sni"><i>Idem ibid.</i></span> He saith also
    with like commendation (speaking hereof, and writing upon this place)
    that <i>Moses</i> doth accommodate and fitten for the understanding of
    the common people, in a rude and grosse stile, those things which he
    there delivereth; forbearing once to rehearse the name of sathan. And
    further he saith, that this order may not be thought of <i>Moses</i><span class="sni"><i>Idem ibid.</i></span> his
    owne devise; but to be taught him by the spirit of God: for such was
    (saith he)<span class="sni"><i>Idem ibid.</i></span> in those daies the childish age of the church, which was
    unable to receive higher or profounder doctrine. Finallie, he saith
    even hereupon, that the Lord hath supplied, with the secret light of
    his spirit, whatsoever wanted in plainenes and clearenes of externall
    words.</p>

  <p>If it be said, according to experience, that certeine other beasts are
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
    farre more subtill than the serpent: they answer, that it is not absurd
    to confesse, that the same gift was taken awaie from him, by God,
    bicause he brought destruction to mankind. Which is more (me thinkes)
    than need be granted in that behalfe.<span class="sni">Matt. 10, 16.</span> For Christ saith not; Be yee wise
    as serpents/<span class="snp"><b>386.</b></span> were before their transgression: but, Be wise as serpents
    are. I would learne what impietie, absurditie, or offense it is to
    hold, that <i>Moses</i>, under the person of the poisoning serpent or snake,
    describeth the divell that poisoned <i>Eve</i> with his deceiptfull words,
    and venomous assault.<span class="sni">Isai. 30, 6.<br />Matth 3. 12. 13.<br />Luk.
    3, &amp;c.<br />Gen. 3.</span> Whence commeth it else, that the divell is called
    so often, The viper, The serpent, &amp;c: and that his children are called
    the generation of vipers; but upon this first description of the divell
    made by <i>Moses</i>? For I thinke none so grosse, as to suppose, that the
    wicked are the children of snakes, according to the letter: no more
    than we are to thinke and gather, that God keepeth a booke of life,
    written with penne and inke upon paper; as citizens record their free

    cursse rehearsed by God in that place, whereby witchmongers labour
    so busilie to proove that the divell entered into the bodie of a snake,
    and by consequence can take the bodie of anie other creature at his
    pleasure, &amp;c: reacheth (I thinke) further into the divels matters,
    than we can comprehend, or is needfull for us to know, that understand
    not the waies of the divels creeping, and is farre unlikelie to extend
    to plague the generation of snakes: as though they had beene made
    with legs before that time, and through this cursse were deprived
    of that benefit. And yet, if the divell should have entred into the
    snake, in maner and forme as they suppose; I cannot see in what degree
    of sinne the poore snake should be so guiltie, as that God, who is
    the most righteous judge, might be offended with him. But although
    I abhorre that lewd interpretation of the familie of love,<span class="sni">Familie of love.</span> and such
    other heretikes, as would reduce the whole Bible into allegories:
    yet (me thinkes) the creeping there is rather metaphoricallie or
    significativelie spoken, than literallie; even by that figure, which
    is there prosecuted to the end. Wherein the divell is resembled to
    an odious creature, who as he creepeth upon us to annoie our bodies;
    so doth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
    the divell there creepe into the conscience of <i>Eve</i>, to
    abuse and deceive hir: whose seed nevertheles shall tread downe and
    dissolve his power and malice. And through him, all good christians (as
    <i>Calvine</i><span class="sni"><i>J. Cal. lib. instit. 1. cap. 14. sect.
    18.</i></span> saith) obteine power to doo the like. For we may not imagine
    such a materiall tragedie, as there is described, for the ease of our
    feeble and weake capacities.</p>

  <p>For whensoever we find in the scriptures, that the divell is called
    god, the prince of the world, a strong armed man, to whome is given
    the power of the aier, a roring lion, a serpent, &amp;c: the Holie-ghost
    mooved us thereby, to beware of the most subtill, strong and mightie
    enimie, and to make prepara/tion,<span class="snp" id="p_540"><i>540.</i></span> and arme our selves with faith
    against so terrible an adversarie. And this is the opinion and counsell
    of <i>Calvine</i>,<span class="sni"><i>J. Cal. li. inst. 1. cap. 14.
    sect. 13.</i></span> that we seeing our owne weakenes, &amp; his force manifested
    in such termes, may beware of/<span class="snp"><b>387.</b></span> the divell, and may flie to God for
    spirituall aid and comfort. And as for his corporall assaults, or his
    attempts upon our bodies, his nightwalkings, his visible appearings,
    his dansing with witches, &amp;c: we are neither warned in the scriptures
    of them, nor willed by God or his prophets to flie them; neither is
    there anie mention made of them in the scriptures. And therefore
    thinke I those witchmongers and absurd writers to be as grosse on the
    one side, as the <i>Sadduces</i> are impious and fond on the other; which
    saie, that spirits and divels are onlie motions and affections, and
    that angels are but tokens of Gods power. I for my part confesse with
    <i>Augustine</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Aug. de cura pro mort. &amp;c.</i></span>
    that these matters are above my reach and capacitie: and
    yet so farre as Gods word teacheth me, I will not sticke to saie,
    that they are living creatures, ordeined to serve the Lord in their
    vocation. And although they abode not in their first estate, yet that
    they are the Lords ministers, and executioners of his wrath, to trie
    and tempt in this world, and to punish the reprobate in hell fier in
    the world to come.</p>

    <span class="sni"><i>P. Mart. in loc. com. 9. sect. 14.</i></span>to
    use few words in a long matter, and plaine termes in a doubtfull
    case, this is mine opinion concerning this present argument. First,
    that divels are spirits, and no bodies. For (as <i>Peter Martyr</i> saith)
    spirits and bodies are by antithesis opposed one to another: so as
    a bodie is no spirit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
    nor a spirit a bodie. And that the divell,
    whether he be manie or one (for by the waie you shall understand, that
    he is so spoken of in the scriptures, as though there were
    <sup>a</sup>but<span class="sni"><sup>a</sup> 1. Sam. 22.<br />Luk. 8.<br />John. 8.<br />Eph. 6.<br />2. Tim. 2.<br />1. Pet. 5.</span>

    <span class="sni"><sup>b</sup> Coloss. 1, verse. 16.<br />1. Cor. 10.<br />Matth. 8, &amp;, 10.<br />Luke. 4.</span>
    were manie legions, the sense whereof I have alreadie declared according to <i>Calvins</i> opinion, he is
    a creature made by God, and that for vengeance, as it is
    <sup>c</sup>written<span class="sni"><sup>c</sup> Sap. 1.<br />Apocal. 4.</span>
    in <i>Eccl.</i> 39. <i>verse.</i> 28: and of himselfe naught, though emploied
    by God to necessarie and good purposes. For in places, where it is written, that
    <sup>d</sup>all<span class="sni"><sup>d</sup> 1. Tim. 4, 4</span>
    the creatures of God are good; and againe, when God, in the creation of the world,
    <sup>e</sup>sawe<span class="sni"><sup>e</sup> Gen. 1.</span>
    all that he had made was good: the divell is not comprehended within those words of
    commendation. For it is written that he was a
    <sup>f</sup>murtherer<span class="sni"><sup>f</sup> Gen. 8. 44.</span>
    from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, bicause there is no truth in
    him; but when he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his owne, as being
    a lier, and the father of lies, and (as <i>John</i> saith)<span class="sni">1. Joh. 3. 8.<br />Isai. 54. 16.</span> a sinner from
    the beginning. Neither was his creation (so farre as I can find) in
    that weeke that God made man, and those other creatures mentioned in
    <i>Genesis</i> the first; and yet God created him purposelie to destroie.
    I take his substance to be such as no man can by learning define, nor
    by wisedome search out. <i>M. Deering</i><span class="sni">Edw. Deering,
    in his read. upon the Hebr. 1. reading the 6.</span> saith, that <i>Paule</i> himselfe,
    reckoning up principalities, powers, &amp;c: addeth, Everie name that is
    named in this world, or in the world to come. A cleere sentence (saith
    he) of <i>Paules</i> modestie, in confessing a holie ignorance of the state/<span class="snp"><b>388.</b></span>
    of angels: which name is also given to divels in other places of the
    scripture. His essence also and his forme is so proper and peculiar
    (in mine opinion) unto himselfe, as he himselfe cannot alter it, but
    must needs be content therewith, as with that which God hath ordeined
    for him,<span class="sni">Eph. 6, 12.<br />Col. 2, 16.<br />Matth. 25.</span> and assigned unto him, as peculiarlie as he hath given to us
    our substance without power to alter the same at our pleasures. For we
    find not that a spirit can make a bodie, more than a bodie can make a
    spirit: the spirit of God excepted, which is omnipotent. Nevertheles,
    I learne that their nature is prone to all mischeefe: for as the verie
    signification of an enimie and an accuser is wrapped up in <i>Sathan</i>
    and <i>Diabolus</i>;<span class="sni">1. Pet. 5.</span> so dooth Christ himselfe declare him to be in the
    thirteenth of <i>Matthew</i>.<span class="sni">Idem ibid.</span> And therefore he brooketh well his name: for
    he lieth dailie in wait, not onelie to corrupt, but also to destroie
    mankind;<span class="sni">Matt. 25. 41.</span> being (I saie) the verie tormentor appointed by God to afflict
    the wicked in this world with wicked temptations, and in the world
    to come with hell fier. But I may not here forget how <i>M. Mal.</i><span class="sni"><i>Mal.
    malef. par. 1. quæ. 5.</i></span> and
    the residue of that crew doo ex/pound<span class="snp" id="p_542"><i>542.</i></span> this word <i>Diabolus</i>: for <i>Dia</i>

    etymon of the word <i>Diabolus</i>.</span> whereby they gather

    Whereas in truth the wicked may be said to eate up and swallowe downe
    the divell, rather than the divell to eate up them; though it may well
    be said by a figure, that the divell like a roring lion seeketh whome
    he may devoure: which is ment of the soule and spirituall devouring, as

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_t.png" width="75" height="75" alt='T' /></span>OUCHING
    the manifold signification of this word [Spirit]*<span class="sni">[*[] in text.]</span> I
    have elsewhere in this breefe discourse told you my mind: which is a
    word nothing differing in Hebrue from breath or wind. For all these
    words following; to wit, <i>Spiritus</i>, <i>Ventus</i>, <i>Flatus</i>, <i>Halitus</i>, are
    indifferentlie used by the Holie-ghost, and called by this Hebrue word
    <b>רוח</b> in the sacred scripture. For further proofe whereof I cite unto you
    the words of <i>Isaie</i>;<span class="sni">Isai. 30, 28.</span> For his spirit (or breath) is as a river that
    overfloweth up to the necke, &amp;c: in which place the prophet describeth
    the comming of God in heate and indignation unto judgement, &amp;c. I cite
    also unto you the words of <i>Zacharie</i>;<span class="sni">Zach. 6, 5.</span>
    These are the foure spirits of
    the heaven, &amp;c. Likewise in <i>Genesis</i>;<span class="sni">Gen. 1, 2.</span> And the spirit of GOD mooved
    upon the waters. Moreover, I cite unto you the words of Christ;<span class="sni">Joh. 3, 8.</span> The
    spirit (or/<span class="snp" id="p_544"><i>544.</i></span> wind) bloweth where it listeth. Unto which said places
    infinite more might be added out of holie writ, tending all to this
    purpose; namelie, to give us this for a note, that all the saiengs
    above cited, with manie more that I could alledge, where mention is
    made of spirit, the Hebrue text useth no word but one; to wit, <b>רוח</b>
    which signifieth (as I said) <i>Spiritum</i>, <i>ventum</i>, <i>flatum</i>, <i>halitum</i>; which
    may be Englished, Spirit, wind, blast, breath.</p>

  <p>But before I enter upon the verie point of my purpose, it shall not
    be amisse, to make you acquainted with the collection of a certeine
    Schoole divine, who distinguisheth and divideth this word [Spirit]*
    <span class="sni">*<i>Eras. Sarcer. in dictio. Scholast. doctr. lit. S.</i></span>
    into six significations; saieng that it is sometimes taken for the
    aier, sometimes for the wind, sometimes for/<span class="snp"><b>390.</b></span> the bodies of the
    blessed, sometimes for the soules of the blessed, sometimes for the
    power imaginative or the mind of man; and sometimes for God. Againe
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
    he saith, that of spirits there are two sorts, some created and some
    uncreated.</p>

  <p>A spirit uncreated (saith he) is God himselfe, and it is essentiallie
    taken, and agreeth unto the three persons notionallie, to the Father,
    the Sonne, and the Holie-ghost personallie. A spirit created is a
    creature, and that is likewise of two sorts; to wit, bodilie, and
    bodilesse. A bodilie spirit is also of two sorts: for some kind of
    spirit is so named of spiritualnes, as it is distinguished from
    bodilinesse: otherwise it is called <i>Spiritus á spirando, id est, á
    flando</i>, of breathing or blowing, as the wind dooth.</p>

  <p>A bodilesse spirit is one waie so named of spiritualnes, and then it
    is taken for a spirituall substance; and is of two sorts: some make a
    full and complet kind, and is called complet or perfect, as a spirit
    angelicall: some doo not make a full and perfect kind, and is called
    incomplet or unperfect, as the soule. There is also the spirit vitall,
    which is a certeine subtill or verie fine substance necessarilie
    disposing and tending unto life. There be moreover spirits naturall,
    which are a kind of subtill and verie fine substances, disposing and
    tending unto equall complexions of bodies. Againe there be spirits
    animall, which are certeine subtill and verie fine substances disposing
    and tempering the bodie, that it might be animated of the forme, that
    is, that it might be perfected of the reasonable soule. Thus farre
    he. In whose division you see a philosophicall kind of proceeding,
    though not altogether/<span class="snp" id="p_545"><i>545.</i></span>
    to be condemned, yet in everie point not to be approoved.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Erasm. Sar. in lib. loc. &amp; lit. prædictis.</i></span>
    Now to the spirit of spirits, I meane the principall and holie spirit
    of God, which one defineth or rather describeth to be the third person
    in trinitie issuing from the father and the sonne, no more the charitie
    dilection and love of the father and the sonne, than the father is the
    charitie dilection and love of the sonne and Holie-ghost. An other
    treating upon the same argument, proceedeth in this reverent manner:
    <span class="sni"><i>Laurent. à Villavicentio in phrasib. s. script. lit. S.
    pag. 176.</i></span>The holie spirit is the vertue or power of God, quickening, nourishing,
    fostering and perfecting all things: by whose onlie breathing it
    commeth to passe that we both know and love GOD, and become at the
    length like unto him: which spirit is the pledge and earnest pennie of
    grace, and beareth witnesse unto our heart, whiles wee crie <i>Abba</i>,
    Father.<span class="sni">Rom. 8, 15.<br />2. Cor. 6, 5.</span>
    This spirit is called the spirit of GOD, the spirit of Christ,
    and the spirit of him which raised up Jesus from the dead.</p>

  <p>Jesus Christ, for that he received not the spirit by measure, but in
    fulnesse, doth call it his spirit; saieng:<span class="sni">John. 15, 26.</span> When the comforter shall
    come, whome I will send, even the holie spirit, he shall testifie of
    me. This spirit hath diverse metaphoricall names attributed thereunto
    in the holie scriptures. It is called by the name of water,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span> bicause
    it washeth, comforteth, moisteneth, softeneth, and maketh fruitefull
    with all godlinesse and vertues the minds of men, which otherwise would
    be uncleane, comfortlesse, hard, drie, and barren of all goodnesse:
    wherupon the prophet <i>Isaie</i><span class="sni">Isai. 44.</span> saith; I will powre water upon the
    thirstie, and floods upon the drie ground, &amp;c./<span class="snp"><b>391.</b></span> Wherewith-all the words
    of Christ doo agree;<span class="sni">John. 7, 38.</span> Hee that beleeveth in me, as saith the scripture,
    out of his bellie shall flowe rivers of waters of life. And else where;
    <span class="sni">John. 4, 14.</span>Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall never be
    more a thirst. Other places likewise there be, wherein the holie spirit
    is signified by the name of water and flood: as in the 13. of <i>Isaie</i>,
    the 29. of <i>Ezech.</i> the 146. <i>Psalme</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> The same spirit by reason
    of the force and vehemencie thereof is termed fier. For it doth purifie
    and cleanse the whole man from top to toe, it doth burne out the soile
    and drosse of sinnes, and setteth him all in a flaming and hot burning
    zeale to preferre and further God’s glorie. Which plainelie appeared in
    the apostles, who when they had re/ceived<span class="snp" id="p_546"><i>546.</i></span> the spirit, they spake fierie
    words, yea such words as were uncontrollable, in so much as in none
    more than in them this saieng of the prophet <i>Jeremie</i><span class="sni">Jer. 23, 29.</span> was verified,
    <i>Nunquid non verba mea sunt quasi ignis?</i> Are not my words even as it
    were fier? This was declared and shewed by those fierie toongs, which
    were seene upon the apostles after they had received the holie spirit.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this spirit is called annointing, or ointment, bicause that
    as in old time preests and kings were by annointing deputed to their
    office and charge, and so were made fit and serviceable for the same:
    even so the elect are not so much declared as renewed and made apt by
    the training up of the holie spirit, both to live well and also to
    glorifie God. Whereupon dependeth the saieng of <i>John</i>;<span class="sni">1. Joh. 2, 20.</span> And yee have
    no need that anie should teach you, but as the same ointment doth
    teach you. It is also called in scripture, The oile of gladnesse and
    rejoising, whereof it is said in the booke of <i>Psalmes</i>;<span class="sni">Psal. 44.</span> God even thy
    God hath annointed thee with the oile of joy &amp; gladnes, &amp;c.<span class="sni"><i>Cyrill.
    in evang. Joh. lib. 3. cap. 14.</i></span> And by
    this goodlie and comfortable name of oile in the scriptures is the
    mercie of God oftentimes expressed, because the nature of that doth
    agree with the propertie and qualitie of this. For as oile doth flote
    and swim above all other liquors, so the mercie of God doth surpasse
    and overreach all his works, and the same doth most of all disclose it
    selfe to miserable man.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Exod. 8.</span>It is likewise called the finger of God, that is, the might and power
    of God: by the vertue whereof the apostles did cast out divels; to
    wit, even by the finger of God. It is called the spirit of truth,
    because it maketh men true and faithfull in their vocation: and for
    that it is the touchstone to trie all counterfet devises of mans
    braine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
    and all vaine sciences, prophane practises, deceitfull arts,
    and circumventing inventions; such as be in generall all sorts of
    witchcrafts and inchantments, within whose number are comprehended all
    those wherewith I have had some dealing in this my discoverie; to wit,
    charmes or incantations, divinations, augurie, judiciall astrologie,
    nativitie casting, alcumystrie, conjuration, lotshare, poperie which is
    meere paltrie, with diverse other: not one wherof no nor all together
    are able to stand to the triall and examination, which this spirit of
    truth shall and will take of those false and evill spirits. Naie, they
    shalbe found, when/<span class="snp" id="p_547"><i>547.</i></span> they are laid into the balance, to be lighter than
    vanitie: verie drosse, when they once come to be tried by the fervent
    heate of this spirit; and like chaffe, when this spirit bloweth upon
    them, driven awaie with a violent whirlewind: such is the per/fection,<span class="snp"><b>392.</b></span>
    integritie, and effectuall operation of this spirit, whose working as
    it is manifold, so it is marvellous, and therefore may and is called
    the spirit of spirits.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The holie spirit can abide nothing that is carnall, and
    uncleane.</span>This spirit withdrawing it selfe from the harts of men, for that it
    will not inhabit and dwell where sinne hath dominion, giveth place unto
    the spirit of error and blindnesse, to the spirit of servitude and
    compunction, which biteth, gnaweth, and whetteth their harts with a
    deadlie hate of the gospell; in so much as it greeveth their minds and
    irketh their eares either to heare or understand the truth; of which
    disease properlie the phariseis of old were, and the papists even now
    are sicke. Yea, the want of this good spirit is the cause that manie
    fall into the spirit of perversenes and frowardnes, into the spirit of
    giddinesse, lieng, drowzines, and dulnesse: according as the prophet
    <i>Isaie</i><span class="sni">Isai. 29, 10.</span> saith; For the Lord hath covered you with a spirit of slumber,
    and hath shut up your eies: and againe else-where, <i>Dominus miscuit in
    medio, &amp;c</i>:<span class="sni">Isai. 19, 14.</span> The Lord hath mingled among them the spirit of giddinesse,
    and hath made <i>Aegypt</i> to erre, as a dronken man erreth in his vomit:
    as it is said by <i>Paule</i>;<span class="sni">Ro. 1, 21, 23.</span> And their foolish hart was blinded, and God
    gave them over unto their owne harts lusts. Which punishment <i>Moses</i><span class="sni">Deuter. 28, 28, 29.</span>
    threateneth unto the Jews; The Lord shall smite thee with madnesse,
    with blindnesse and amazednesse of mind, and thou shalt grope at high
    noone as a blind man useth to grope, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>In summe, this word [Spirit] dooth signifie a secret force and power,
    wherewith our minds are mooved and directed; if unto holie things,
    then is it the motion of the holie spirit, of the spirit of Christ and
    of God: if unto evill things, then is it the suggestion of the wicked
    spirit, of the divell, and of satan.<span class="sni">A question.</span> Whereupon I inferre, by the waie
    of a question, with what spirit we are to suppose such to be mooved, as
    either practise anie of the vanities treated upon in this
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span> booke, or
    through credulitie addict themselves thereunto as unto divine oracles,
    or the voice of angels breakeing through the clouds? We cannot impute
    this motion unto/<span class="snp" id="p_548"><i>548.</i></span> the good spirit; for then they should be able to
    <span class="sni">An answer.</span>discerne betweene the nature of spirits, and not swarve in judgement:
    it followeth therefore, that the spirit of blindnes and error dooth
    seduce them; so that it is no mervell if in the alienation of their
    minds they take falsehood for truth, shadowes for substances, fansies
    for verities, &amp;c: for it is likelie<span class="sni">A great likelihood no doubt.</span> that the good spirit of God hath
    forsaken them, or at leastwise absented it selfe from them: else would
    they detest these divelish devises of men, which consist of nothing but
    delusions and vaine practises, whereof (I suppose) this my booke to be
    a sufficient discoverie.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Judgement distinguished.</span>It will be said that I ought not to judge, for he that judgeth shalbe
    judged. Whereto I answer, that judgement is to be understood of
    three kind of actions in their proper nature; whereof the first are
    secret, and the judgement of them shall apperteine to God, who in time
    will disclose what so ever is done in covert, and that by his just
    judgement. The second are mixed actions, taking part of hidden and part
    of open, so that by reason of their uncerteintie and doubtfulnes they
    are discussable and to be tried; these after due examination are to
    have their competent judgement, and are incident to the magistrate. The
    third are manifest and/<span class="snp"><b>393.</b></span> evident, and such as doo no lesse apparentlie
    shew themselves than an inflammation of bloud in the bodie: and of
    these actions everie private man giveth judgement, bicause they be
    of such certeintie, as that of them a man may as well conclude, as
    to gather, that bicause the sunne is risen in the east, <i>Ergo</i>*<span class="sni">[* <i>Ital.</i>]</span> it
    is morning: he is come about and is full south, <i>Ergo</i>* it is high
    noone; he is declining and closing up in the west, <i>Ergo</i>* it is
    evening. So that the objection is answered.</p>

  <p>Howbeit, letting this passe, and spirituallie to speake of this spirit,
    which whiles manie have wanted, it hath come to passe that they have
    prooved altogether carnall; &amp; not savouring heavenlie divinitie have
    tumbled into worsse than philosophicall barbarisme:<span class="sni">* <i>Josias Simlerus li. 4. ca. 5. adversus veteres &amp; novos
    Antitrinitarios, &amp;c.</i></span> &amp; these be such
    as of writers are called <i>Pneumatomachi</i>, a sect so injurious to the
    holie spirit of God, that contemning the sentence of Christ, wherein
    he foretelleth that the sinne against the holie spirit is never to be
    pardoned, neither in this world nor in the world to come, they doo not
    onelie denie him to be God, but also pull from him all being, and with
    the <i>Sadduces</i> main/teine<span class="snp" id="p_549"><i>549.</i></span> there is none such; but that under and by the
    name of holie spirit is ment a certeine divine force, wherewith our
    minds are mooved, and the grace and favour of God whereby we are his
    beloved. Against these shamelesse enimies of the holie spirit, I will
    not use materiall weapons, but syllogisticall charmes. And
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span> first I will
    set downe some of their paralogysmes or false arguments; and upon the
    necke of them inferre fit confutations grounded upon sound reason and
    certeine truth.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">1. Objectiō. The scripture dooth never call the holie spirit
    God.</span>Their first argument is knit up in this manner. The holie spirit is no
    where expresselie called God in the scriptures; <i>Ergo</i> he is not God,
    or at leastwise he is not to be called God. The antecedent of this
    argument is false; bicause the holie spirit hath the title or name
    of God in the fift of the <i>Acts</i>. <span class="sni">* The first answer.
    A refutation of the antecedent, &amp;c.</span>Againe, the consequent is false.
    For although he were not expresselie called God, yet should it not
    therupon be concluded that he is not verie God; bicause unto him are
    attributed all the properties of God, which unto this doo equallie
    belong. And as we denie not that the father is the true light, although
    it be not directlie written of the father, but of the sonne; He was
    the true light giving light to everie man that cōmeth into this world:
    so likewise it is not to be denied, that the spirit is God, although
    the scripture dooth not expresselie and simplie note it; sithence it
    ascribeth equall things thereunto; as the properties of God, the works
    of God, the service due to GOD, and that it dooth interchangeablie take
    the names of Spirit and of God oftentimes. They therefore that see
    these things attributed unto the holie spirit, and yet will not suffer
    him to be called by the name of God; doo as it were refuse to grant
    unto <i>Eve</i> the name of <i>Homo</i>,†<span class="sni">[† <i>Ital.</i>]</span> whome notwithstanding they confesse
    to be a creature reasonable and mortall.</p>

  <p>The second reason is this. <i>Hilarie</i><span class="sni">2. Objectiō. <i>Hilarie</i> doth not call the spirit God, neither
    is he so named in the common collects.</span> in all his twelve bookes of
    the Trinitie dooth no where write that the holie spirit is to be
    worshipped; he never giveth therunto the name of God, neither dares he
    otherwise pronounce thereof, than that it is the spirit of God. Besides
    this, there are usuall praiers of the church commonlie called the
    Collects, whereof some are made to the father, some to the sonne, but
    none to the holie spirit; and/<span class="sni"><b>395[4].</b></span> yet in them all mention is made of the
    three persons. *Hereunto<span class="sni">* The 2. answer.</span> I answer, that although <i>Hilarie</i> dooth
    not openlie call the holie spirit, God:/<span class="snp" id="p_550"><i>550.</i></span> yet doth he constantly denie
    it to be a creature. Now if any aske me why <i>Hilarie</i> was so coie &amp;
    nice to name the holie spirit, God, whom he denieth to be a creature,
    when as notwithstanding betweene God and a creature there is no meane:
    I will in good sooth saie what I thinke. I suppose that <i>Hilarie</i>,
    <span class="sni"><i>Hilarius lib. 12. de Triade</i></span>
    for himselfe, thought well of the godhead of the holie spirit: but
    this opinion was thrust and forced upon him of the <i>Pneumatomachi</i>,
    who at that time rightlie deeming of the sonne did erwhiles joine
    themselves to those that were sound of judgement. There is also in the
    ecclesiasticall historie a little booke which they gave <i>Liberius</i>
    a bishop of <i>Rome</i>, whereinto they foisted the <i>Nicene</i> creed. And
    that <i>Hilarie</i> was a freend of the <i>Pneumatomachi</i>, it is perceived
    in his booke <i>De synodis</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
    where he writeth in this maner;<span class="sni">The place is long, and therefore I had rather referre the
    reader unto the booke than heere to insert so many lines.</span> <i>Nihil
    autem mirum vobis videri debet, fratres charissimi, &amp;c</i>: It ought to
    seeme no wonder unto you deere brethren, &amp;c. As for the objection of
    the praiers of the church called the collects, that in them the holie
    spirit is not called upon by name: we oppose and set against them the
    songs of the church, wherein the said spirit is called upon. But the
    collects are more ancient than the songs, hymnes, and anthems. I will
    not now contend about ancientnesse, neither will I compare songs and
    collects togither; but I say thus much onelie, to wit, that in the most
    ancient times of the church the holie spirit hath beene openlie called
    upon in the congregation. Now if I be charged to give an instance,
    let this serve. In the collect upon trinitie sundaie it is thus said:
    Almightie and everlasting God,<span class="sni"><i>Collecta in die domin.
    sanctæ Trinit.</i></span> which hast given unto us thy servants
    grace by the confession of a truth to acknowledge the glorie of the
    eternall trinitie, and in the power of the divine Majestie to worship
    the unitie: we beseech thee that thorough the stedfastnesse of this
    faith, we may evermore be defended from all adversitie, which livest
    and reignest one God world without end. Now bicause that in this
    collect, where the trinitie is expresselie called upon, the names of
    persons are not expressed; but almightie and everlasting God invocated,
    who abideth in trinitie and unitie; it doth easilie appeare elsewhere
    also that the persons being not named, under the name of almightie and
    everlasting God, not onelie the father*<span class="sni">[* ? is]</span> to be understood, but God
    which abideth in trinitie and unitie, that is the father, the sonne,
    and the Holie-ghost./</p>

  <p><span class="snp" id="p_551"><i>551.</i></span>A third objection of theirs is this.<span class="sni">3. Objectiō. The spirit is not to be praied unto but the
    father onlie.</span> The sonne of GOD oftentimes
    praieng in the gospels, speaketh unto the father, promiseth the
    holie spirit, and dooth also admonish the apostles to praie unto the
    heavenlie father, but yet in the name of the sonne. Besides that, he
    prescribeth them this forme of praier: Our father which art in heaven.
    <i>Ergo</i>†<span class="sni">[† <i>Ital.</i>]</span> the father onlie is to be called upon, and consequentlie
    the father onelie is that one and verie true God, of whome it is
    written; Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onelie shalt thou
    serve.</p>

  <p>*Whereto<span class="sni">* 3. Answer. The consequent is denied.</span> I answer first by denieng the consequent; The sonne
    praied to the father onelie, <i>Ergo</i>[B] the father onlie is of us also
    to be praied unto. For the sonne of GOD is distinguished of us both
    in person and in office: he as a mediator maketh intercession for us
    to the father: and although the/<span class="snp"><b>395.</b></span> sonne and the holie spirit doo both
    togither receive and take us into favour with God; yet is he said to
    intreat the father for us; bicause the father is the fountaine of all
    counsels &amp; divine works. Furthermore, touching the forme of praieng
    prescribed of Christ, it is not necessarie that the fathers
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>name shuld
    personallie be there taken, sith there is no distinction of persons
    made: but by the name of father indefinitelie we understand God or the
    essence of God, the father, the son, and the Holie-ghost. For this name
    hath not alwaies a respect unto the generation of the sonne of God;
    but God is called the father of the faithfull, bicause of his gratious
    and free adopting of them, the foundation whereof is the sonne of God,
    in whom we be adopted: but yet so adopted, that not the father onelie
    receiveth us into his favour; but with him also the sonne and the holy
    spirit dooth the same. Therefore when we in the beginning of praier doo
    advertise our selves of Gods goodnesse towards us; we doo not cast an
    eie to the father alone, but also to the sonne, who gave us the spirit
    of adoption; and to the holie spirit, in whom we crie <i>Abba</i>, Father.
    And if so be that invocation and praier were restreined to the father
    alone, then had the saints doone amisse, in calling upon, invocating,
    and praieng to the sonne of God, and with the sonne the holy spirit,
    in baptisme, according to the forme by Christ himselfe assigned and
    delivered.</p>

  <p>Another objection is out of the fourth of <i>Amos</i>,<span class="sni">[Am. 4, 13.]</span> in this maner. For lo
    it is I that make the thunder, and create the spirit, and/<span class="snp" id="p_552"><i>552.</i></span> shew unto
    men their Christ,<span class="sni">4. Objectiō. Amos saith that the spirit was created.</span> making the light and the clouds, and mounting above
    the hie places of the earth, the Lord God of hosts is his name. Now
    bicause it is read in that place, Shewing unto men their Christ; the
    <i>Pneumatomachi</i> contended that these words are to be understood of the
    holie spirit.</p>

  <p>*But<span class="sni">* 4. Answer. Spirit in this place signifieth wind.</span> <i>Ambrose</i> in his booke <i>De spiritu sancto, lib. 2. cap.
    7.</i> doth rightlie answer, that by spirit in this place is ment the
    wind: for if the prophets purpose and will had beene to speake of
    the holie spirit, he would not have begunne with thunder, nor have
    ended with light and clouds. Howbeit, the same father saith; If anie
    suppose that these words are to be drawne unto the interpretation of
    the holie spirit, bicause the prophet saith, Shewing unto men their
    Christ; he ought also to draw these words unto the mysterie of the
    Lords incarnation: and he expoundeth thunder to be the words of the
    Lord, and spirit to be the reasonable and perfect soule. But the
    former interpretation is certeine and convenient with the words of the
    prophet, by whom there is no mention made of Christ; but the power of
    God is set foorth in his works. Behold (saith the prophet) he that
    formeth the mountaines, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man
    what is his thought, which maketh the morning darknesse, and walketh
    upon the hie places of the earth, the Lord God of hosts is his name. In
    this sort <i>Santes</i><span class="sni">To create is not him to be made that was not.</span> a right skilfull man in the Hebrew toong translateth
    this place of the prophet. But admit this place were written of the
    holie spirit, &amp; were not appliable either to the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>wind or to the
    Lords incarnation: yet doth it not follow that the holie spirit is a
    creature; bicause this word of Creating doth not alwaies signifie a
    making of something out of nothing; as <i>Eusebius</i><span class="sni"><i>Euseb.
    Cæsariens. li. 3. adversus Marcellum.</i></span> in expounding these
    words (The Lord created me in the beginning of his waies) writeth thus.
    The prophet in the person of God,/<span class="snp"><b>396.</b></span> saieng; Behold I am he that made
    the thunder, and created the spirit, and shewed unto men their Christ:
    this word Created is not so to be taken, as that it is to be concluded
    thereby, that the same was not before. For God hath not so created the
    spirit, sithence by the same he hath shewed &amp; declared his Christ unto
    all men. Neither was it a thing of late beginning under the sonne:
    but it was before all beginning, and was then sent, when the apostles
    were gathered togither, when a sound like thunder came/<span class="snp" id="p_553"><i>553.</i></span> from heaven,
    as it had beene the comming of a mightie wind: this word Created being
    used for sent downe, for appointed, ordeined, &amp;c: and the word thunder
    signifieng in another kind of maner the preaching of the gospels. The
    like saieng is that of the <i>Psalmist</i>, A cleane hart create in me O
    God: wherein he praied not as one having no hart, but as one that had
    such a hart as needed purifieng, as needed perfecting: &amp; this phrase
    also of the scripture, That he might create two in one new man; that
    is, that he might joine, couple, or gather together, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">5. Objectiō. All things were made by the son, <i>Ergo</i> the
    spirit was also made by him.</span>Furthermore, the <i>Pneumatomachi</i> by these testimonies insuing endevor
    to proove the holie spirit to be a creature. Out of <i>John</i> the 1. chap.
    By this word were all things made, and without it nothing was made. Out
    of 1. <i>Cor.</i> 8. Wee have one God the father, even he from whome are all
    things, and we in him, and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whome are all
    things, and we by him. Out of the 1. <i>Coloss.</i> By him were all things
    made, things in heaven, and things in earth, visible and invisible, &amp;c.
    Now if al things were made by the sonne, it followeth that by him the
    holie spirit was also made.</p>

  <p>*Whereto<span class="sni">* 5. Answer. Universall propositiōs or speeches are to be restrained.</span> I answer, that when all things are said to be made
    by the sonne, that same universall proposition is restrained by
    <i>John</i> himselfe to a certeine kind of things: Without him (saith the
    evangelist) was nothing made that was made. Therefore it is first to be
    shewed that the holie spirit was made, and then will we conclude out of
    <i>John</i>, that if he were made, he was made of the sonne. The scripture
    doth no where saie that the holie spirit was made of the father or of
    the sonne, but to proceed, to come, and to be sent from them both. Now
    if these universall propositions are to suffer no restraint, it shall
    follow that the father was made of the sonne: than the which what is
    more absurd and wicked?</p>

  <p><span class="sni">6. Objectiō. The spirit knoweth not the father &amp; the sonne.</span>
    Againe, they object out of <i>Matth.</i> 11. None knoweth the sonne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span> but the
    father, and none the father but the sonne; to wit, of and by himselfe:
    for otherwise both the angels, &amp; to whomsoever else it shall please the
    sonne to reveale the father, these doo know both the father and the
    sonne. Now if so be the spirit be not equall with the father and the
    sonne in knowledge, he is not onelie unequall and lesser than they, but
    also no God: for ignorance is not/<span class="snp" id="p_554"><i>554.</i></span> incident unto God.</p>

  <p>*Whereto<span class="sni">* 6. Answer. How exclusive propositions or speeches are to be interpreted.</span>
    I answer, that where in holie scripture we doo meete with
    universall propositions negative or exclusive, they are not to be
    expounded of one person, so as the rest are excluded; but creatures or
    false gods are to be excluded, and whatsoever else is without or beside
    the essence and being of God. Reasons to proove and confirme this
    interpretation, I could bring verie manie, whereof I will adde some
    for example. In the seaventh of <i>John</i> it is said; When Christ shall
    come, none shall knowe from whence he is: notwithstanding which words
    the Jewes thought that neither God nor his angels should be ignorant
    from whence Christ/<span class="snp"><b>397.</b></span> should be. In the fourth to the <i>Galathians</i>; A
    mans covenant or testament confirmed with authoritie no bodie dooth
    abrogate, or adde anie thing thereunto. No just man dooth so; but
    tyrants and truce-breakers care not for covenants. In <i>John</i> eight;
    Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the middest. And yet
    it is not to be supposed that a multitude of people was not present,
    and the disciples of Christ likewise; but the word <i>Solus</i>, alone, is
    referred to the woman’s accusers, who withdrew themselves awaie everie
    one, and departed. In the sixt of <i>Marke</i>; When it was evening, the
    ship was in the middest of the sea, and he alone upon land: he was
    not alone upon land or shore, for the same was not utterlie void of
    dwellers: but he had not anie of his disciples with him, nor anie bodie
    to carrie him a shipboord unto his disciples. Manie phrases or formes
    of speeches like unto these are to be found in the sacred scriptures,
    and in authors both Greeke and Latine, whereby we understand, that
    neither universall negative nor exclusive particles are strictlie to
    be urged, but to be explaned in such sort as the matter in hand will
    beare. When as therefore the sonne alone is said to know the father,
    and it is demanded whether the holie spirit is debarred from knowing
    the father; out of other places of scriptures judgment is to be given
    in this case. In some places the holie spirit is counted and reckoned
    with the father and the sonne jointlie: wherefore he is not to be
    separated. Else-where also it is attributed to the holie spirit that he
    alone dooth know the things which be of God, and searcheth the deepe
    secrets of God: wherefore from him the knowing of God is not to be
    excluded./</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span></p>

  <p><span class="snp" id="p_555"><i>555.</i></span><span class="sni">7. Objectiō.
    The spirit praieth for us.</span>They doo yet further object, that it is not convenient or fit for God
    after the manner of suters to humble and cast downe himselfe: but the
    holie spirit dooth so, praieng and intreating for us with unspeakeable
    grones: <i>Rom.</i> 8. <i>Ergo</i> the holie spirit is not God.</p>

  <p>*Whereto<span class="sni">* 7. Answer. The spirit dooth provoke us to praie.</span> I answer that the holie spirit dooth praie and intreat, in
    so much as he provoketh us to praie, and maketh us to grone and sigh.
    Oftentimes also in the scriptures is that action or deed attributed
    unto God, which we being stirred up and mooved by him doo bring to
    passe. So it is said of God unto <i>Abraham</i>; Now I know that thou
    fearest God: and yet before he would have sacrificed <i>Isaach</i>, God
    knew the verie heart of <i>Abraham</i>: and therefore this word <i>Cognovi</i>,
    I know, is as much as <i>Cognoscere feci</i>, I have made or caused to
    know. And that the spirit to praie and intreat, is the same that, to
    make to praie and intreat, the apostle teacheth even there, writing
    that we have received the spirit of adoption, in whome we crie <i>Abba</i>
    Father. Where it is manifest that it is we which crie, the Holie-ghost
    provoking and forcing us thereunto.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">8. Objectiō. The spirit is sent from the father and the son.</span>Howbeit they go further, and frame this reason. Whosoever is sent,
    the same is inferior and lesser than he of whome he is sent, and
    furthermore he is of a comprehensible substance, bicause he passeth by
    locall motion from place to place: but the holie spirit is sent of the
    father and the sonne, <i>John.</i> 14, 15, &amp; 16. It is powred foorth and
    shed upon men, <i>Acts.</i> 10. <i>Ergo</i> the holie spirit is lesser than the
    Father and the Sonne, and of a comprehensible nature, and consequentlie
    not verie God./</p>

  <p><span class="snp"><b>398.</b></span>*Whereto<span class="sni">* 8. Answer. How the spirit is sent.</span> I answer first, that he which is sent is not alwaies
    lesser than he that sendeth: to proove which position anie meane wit
    may inferre manie instances. Furthermore, touching the sending of the
    holie spirit, we are here to imagine no changing or shifting of place.
    For if the spirit when he goeth foorth from the father and is sent,
    changeth his place, then must the father also be in a place, that
    he may leave it and go to another. And as for the incomprehensible
    nature of the spirit, he cannot leaving his place passe unto another.
    Therefore the sending of the spirit is the eternall and unvariable will
    of God, to doo something by the holie spirit; and the revealing and
    executing of this will by the/<span class="snp" id="p_556"><i>556.</i></span> operation and working of the spirit. The
    spirit was sent to the apostles; which spirit was present with them,
    sith it is present everie-where: but then according to the will of God
    the father hee shewed himselfe present and powerfull.</p>

  <p>Some man may saie; If sending be a revealing and laieng open of
    presence and power, then may the father be said to be sent, bicause he
    himselfe is also revealed. I answer, that when the spirit is said to be
    sent, not onlie the revealing, but the order also of his revealing is
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
    declared; bicause the will of the father and of the sonne, of whom he
    is sent, going before, not in time, but in order of persons, the spirit
    dooth reveale himselfe, the father, and also the sonne. The father
    revealeth himselfe by others, the sonne and the holie spirit, so that
    his will goeth before. Therefore sending is the common worke of all the
    three persons; howbeit, for order of dooing, it is distinguished by
    diverse names. The father will reveale himselfe unto men with the sonne
    and the spirit, and be powerfull in them, and therefore is said to
    send. The sonne and the spirit doo assent unto the will of the father,
    and will that to be doone by themselves, which God will to be doone
    by them; these are said to be sent. And bicause the will of the sonne
    dooth go before the spirit in order of persons, he is also said to send
    the spirit.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">9. Objectiō. The spirit speaketh not of himselfe.</span>Yet for all this they allege, that if the spirit had perfection, then
    would he speake of himselfe, and not stand in need alwaies of anothers
    admonishment: but he speaketh not of himselfe, but speaketh what he
    heareth, as Christ expresselie testifieth <i>John.</i> 16. <i>Ergo</i> he is
    unperfect, and whatsoever he hath it is by partaking, and consequentlie
    he is not God.</p>

  <p>*Whereto<span class="sni">* The 9. answer.</span> I answer, that this argument is stale: for it was objected
    by heretikes long ago against them that held the true opinion, as
    <i>Cyrill</i><span class="sni"><i>Cyrill. lib. 13. thesaur. cap. 3.</i></span> saith; who answereth, that by the words of Christ is rather
    to be gathered, that the son and the spirit are of the same substance.
    For, the spirit is named the mind of Christ. 1. <i>Cor.</i> 2: and therefore
    he speaketh not of his owne proper will, or against his will in whom
    and from whom he is; but hath all his will and working naturallie
    proceeding from the substance as it were of him.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">10. Objection.</span>Lastlie they argue thus: Everie thing is either unbegotten or unborne,
    or begotten and created; the spirit is not unbegotten,/<span class="snp" id="p_557"><i>557.</i></span> for then he
    were the father; &amp; so there should be two without beginning: neither is
    he begotten, for then he is begotten of the father, and so there shall
    be two/<span class="snp"><b>399.</b></span> sonnes, both brothers; or hee is begotten of the sonne, and
    then shall he be Gods nephue, than the which what can be imagined more
    absurd? <i>Ergo</i> he is created.</p>

  <p>*Wherto<span class="sni">* 10. Ans. The spirit proceedeth</span> I answer, that the division or distribution is unperfect:
    for that member is omitted which is noted of the verie best divine that
    ever was, even Jesus Christ our saviour; namelie, to have proceeded,
    or proceeding: That same holie spirit (saith he) which proceedeth from
    the father. Which place <i>Nazanzen</i> dooth thus interpret. The spirit,
    bicause he proceedeth from thence, is not a creature: and bicause he
    is not begotten, he is not the son; but bicause he is the meane of
    begotten and unbegotten, he shall be God, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>And thus having avoided all these cavils of the
    *<i>Pneumatomachi</i>,<span class="sni">* Such were the Arrians, Tritheits,† Samosatenians,
    &amp;c.</span><span class="sni">† [Tritheists]</span> a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
    sect of heretikes too too injurious to the holie spirit, insomuch
    as they seeke what they can, to rob and pull from him the right of
    his divinitie; I will all Christians to take heed of their pestilent
    opinions, the poison whereof though to them that be resolved in the
    truth it can doo little hurt, yet to such as stand upon a wavering
    point it can doo no great good. Having thus far waded against them,
    and overthrowne their opinions; I must needs exhort all to whom the
    reading hereof shall come, that first they consider with themselves
    what a reverend mysterie all that hitherto hath beene said in this
    chapter concerneth; namelie, the spirit of sanctification, and that
    they so ponder places to and fro, as that they reserve unto the holie
    spirit the glorious title of divinitie, which by nature is to him
    appropriate: esteeming of these <i>Pneumatomachi</i> or <i>Theomachi</i>,<span class="sni"><i>Sus magis in cœno gaudet quàm fonte sereno.</i></span> as of
    swine, delighting more in the durtie draffe of their devises, than in
    the faire fountaine water of Gods word: yea, condemning them of grosser
    ignorance than the old philosophers, who though they savoured little of
    heavenlie theologie, yet some illumination they had of the holie and
    divine spirit,<span class="sni">The hethenish philosophers acknowledged
    the holie spirit.</span> marrie it was somewhat mistie, darke, lame and limping;
    neverthelesse, what it was, and how much or little soever it was, they
    gave thereunto a due reverence, in that they acknowledged and intituled
    it <i>Animam mundi</i>, The soule or life of the world, and (as <i>Nazanzen</i>
    witnesseth) τὸν τοῦ παντος νοῦν, The/<span class="snp" id="p_558"><i>558.</i></span> mind of the universall, and the
    outward breath, or the breath that commeth from without. <i>Porphyrie</i>
    <span class="sni"><i>Cyrill. lib. 1. contra Julianum.</i></span>
    expounding the opinion of <i>Plato</i>, who was not utterlie blind in this
    mysterie, saith that the divine substance doth proceed and extend
    to three subsistencies and beings: and that God is chieflie and
    principallie good, next him the second creator, and the third to be
    the soule of the world: for he holdeth that the divinitie doth extend
    even to this soule. As for <i>Hermes Trismegistus</i>, he saith that all
    things have need of this spirit: for according to his worthinesse he
    supporteth all, he quickeneth and susteineth all, and he is derived
    from the holie fountaine, giving breath and life unto all, and evermore
    remaineth continuall, plentifull, and unemptied.</p>

  <p>And here by the waie I give you a note woorth reading and considering;
    namelie, how all nations in a manner, by a kind of heavenlie influence,
    agree in writing and speaking the name of God with no more than foure
    letters.<span class="sni"><i>Marsilius Ficinus in arg. in Cratyl. Plat.</i></span>
    As for example, the <i>Ægyptians</i> doo call him <i>Theut</i>, the
    <i>Persians</i> call him <i>Syre</i>, the <i>Jewes</i> expresse his unspeakable name
    as well as they can by/<span class="snp"><b>400.</b></span> the word <i>Adonai</i> consisting of foure vowels;
    the <i>Arabians</i> call him <i>Alla</i>, the <i>Mahometists</i> call him <i>Abdi</i>,
    the <i>Greekes</i> call him <i>Theos</i>, the <i>Latines</i> call him <i>Deus</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
    This, although it be not so proper to our present purpose, yet (because
    we are in hand with the holie spirits deitie) is not altogether
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>impertinent.
    But why GOD would have his name as it were universallie
    bounded within the number of foure letters, I can give sundrie
    reasons, which require too long a discourse of words by digression:
    and therefore I will conceale them for this time. These opinions of
    philosophers I have willinglie remembred, that it might appeare, that
    the doctrine concerning the holie spirit is verie ancient; which they
    having taken either out of <i>Moses</i> writings, or out of the works
    of the old fathers, published and set foorth in bookes, though not
    wholie, fullie, and perfectlie understood and knowne: and also that
    our <i>Pneumatomachi</i> may see themselves to be more doltish in divine
    matters than the heathen, who will not acknowledge that essentiall
    and working power of the divinitie wherby all things are quickened:
    which the heathen did after a sort see; after a sort (I saie) bicause
    they separated the soule of the world (which they also call the
    begotten mind) from the most sovereigne and unbe/gotten<span class="snp" id="p_559"><i>559.</i></span> God, and
    imagined certeine differences of degrees, and (as <i>Cyrill</i> saith) did
    Arrianize*<span class="sni">* [Arianize]</span> in the trinitie.</p>

  <p>So then I conclude against these <i>Pneumatomachi</i>, that in so much
    as they imitate the old giants, who piling up <i>Pelion</i><span class="sni"><i>Ovid. lib. metamorph. 1 fab. 5. de gigantib. cœlum
    obsident.</i></span> upon <i>Ossa</i>,
    and them both upon <i>Olympus</i>, attempted by scaling the heavens to
    pull <i>Jupiter</i> out of his throne of estate, &amp; to spoile him of his
    principalitie, and were notwithstanding their strength, whereby they
    were able to carrie huge hilles on their shoulders, overwhelmed
    with those mountaines, and squized under the weight of them even
    to the death: so these <i>Pneumatomachi</i>, being enimies both to the
    holie spirit, and no freends to the holie church (for then would
    they confesse the trinitie in unitie, and the unitie in trinitie,
    and consequentlie also the deitie of the holie spirit) deserve to be
    consumed with the fier of his mouth, the heate whereof by no meanes can
    be slaked, quenched, or avoided. For there is nothing more unnaturall,
    nothing more monstrous, than against the person of the deitie (I meane
    the spirit of sanctification) to oppose mans power, mans wit, mans
    policie, &amp;c: which was well signified by that poeticall fiction of the
    giants, who were termed <i>Anguipedes</i>, Snakefooted: which as <i>Joachimus
    Camerarius</i> expoundeth of wicked counsellors, to whose filthie
    persuasion tyrants doo trust as unto their feete; and <i>James Sadolet</i>
    <span class="sni"><i>Jacob. Sadol. in lib. de laud. philosoph. inscript.
    Phædrus.</i></span>
    interpreteth of philosophers, who trusting overmuch unto their owne
    wits, become so bold in challenging praise for their wisedome, that in
    fine all turneth to follie and confusion: so I expound of heretickes

    precise opinions, or by open violence, &amp;c: assaie to overthrow the
    true religion, to breake the unitie of the church, to denie <i>Cæsar</i>
    his homage, and GOD his dutie, &amp;c: and therefore let <i>Jovis fulmen</i>,

    assure these that there is <i>Divina ultio</i>
    due to all such, as dare in the ficklenes of their fansies arreare
    themselves against the holie spirit; of whom sith they are ashamed here
    upon earth (otherwise they would confidentlie and boldlie confesse
    him both/<span class="snp"><b>401.</b></span> with mouth and pen) he will be ashamed of them in heaven,
    where they are like to be so farre from having anie societie with the
    saints, that their portion shalbe even in full and shaken measure with
    miscreants and infidels. And therefore let us,/<span class="snp" id="p_560"><i>560.</i></span> if we will discerne
    and trie the spirits whether they be of God or no, seeke for the
    illumination of this inlightning spirit, which as it bringeth light
    with it to discover all spirits, so it giveth such a fierie heat, as
    that no false spirit can abide by it for feare of burning. Howbeit
    the holie spirit must be in us, otherwise this prerogative of trieng
    spirits will not fall to our lot.</p>

    the holie spirit is in us, considering that <i>Infiniti ad finitum
    nulla est proportio, neque loci angustia quod immensum est potest
    circumscribi</i>: of that which is infinite, to that which is finite
    there is no proportion; neither can that which is unmeasurable be
    limited or bounded within anie precinct of place, &amp;c. I answer, that

    send in my name. And as for proportion of that which is infinite to
    that which is finite, &amp;c: I will in no case have it thought, that the
    holie spirit is in us, as a bodie placed in a place terminablie; but to
    attribute thereunto, as dulie belongeth to the deitie, an ubiquitie, or
    universall presence; not corporallie and palpablie; but effectuallie,
    mightilie, mysticallie, divinelie, &amp;c. <span class="sni">John. 16,

    <span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_m2.png" width="75" height="75" alt='M' /></span>Agitians,
    <span class="sni">Imaginary Circles.</span>and the more learned sort of Conjurers, make use of
    Circles in various manners, and to various intentions. First, when
    convenience serves not, as to time or place that a real Circle should
    be delineated, they frame an imaginary Circle, by means of Incantations
    and Consecrations, without either Knife, Pensil, or Compasses,
    circumscribing nine foot of ground round about them, which they pretend
    to sanctifie with words and Ceremonies, spattering their Holy Water
    all about so far as the said Limit extendeth; and with a form of
    Consecration following, do alter the property of the ground, that from
    common (as they say) it becomes sanctifi’d, and made fit for Magicall
    uses.</p>

  <h4><i>How to consecrate an imaginary Circle.</i></h4>

  <p class="drop-cap">LEt <span class="sni">The form of Consecration.</span>the Exorcist, being cloathed with a black Garment, reaching to his
    knee, and under that a white Robe of fine Linnen that falls unto his
    ankles, fix himself in the midst of that place where he intends to
    perform his Conjurations: And throwing his old Shooes about ten yards
    from the place, let him put on his consecrated shooes of russet Leather
    with a Cross cut on the top of each shooe. Then with his Magical Wand,
    which must be a new hazel-stick, about two yards of length, he must
    stretch forth his arm to all the four Windes thrice, turning himself
    round at every Winde, and saying all that while with fervency:</p>

  <p><i>I who am the servant of the Highest, do by the vertue of his Holy
    Name</i> Immanuel, <i>sanctifie unto my self the circumference of nine
    foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>

    <span class="gothic">Berith</span>; <i>which ground I take for my proper defence from all
    malignant spirits, that they may have no power over my soul or body,
    nor come beyond these Limitations, but answer truely being summoned,
    without daring to transgress their bounds</i>: <span class="gothic">Worrh</span>*.
    <span class="sni">[* ? <i>Mispr. for</i> Worrah.]</span> <span class="gothic">worrah.
    harcot. Gambalon.</span> ✠✠✠.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The time for Conjurations.</span>Which Ceremonies being performed, the place so sanctified is equivalent
    to any real Circle whatsoever. And in the composition of any Circle for
    Magical feats, the fittest time is the brightest Moon-light, or when
    storms of lightning, winde, or thunder, are raging through the air;
    because at such times the infernal Spirits are nearer unto the earth,
    and can more easily hear the Invocations of the Exorcist.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The places for Circles.</span>As for the places of Magical Circles, they are to be chosen
    melancholly, dolefull, dark and lonely; either in Woods or Deserts,
    or in a place where three wayes meet, or amongst ruines of Castles,
    Abbies, Monasteries, <i>&amp;c.</i> or upon the Sea-shore when the Moon shines
    clear, or else in some large Parlour hung with black, and the floor
    covered with the same, with doors and windowes closely shut, and
    Waxen Candles lighted. But if the Conjuration be for the Ghost of one
    deceased, the fittest places to that purpose are places of the slain,/<span class="snp"><b>216.</b></span>
    Woods where any have killed themselves, Church-yards, Burying-Vaults,
    <i>&amp;c.</i> As also for all sorts of Spirits, the places of their abode
    ought to be chosen, when they are called; as Pits, Caves, and hollow
    places, for Subterranean Spirits: The tops of Turrets, for Aerial
    Spirits: Ships and Rocks of the Sea, for Spirits of the Water: Woods
    and Mountains for Faries, Nymphs, and Satyres; following the like order
    with all the rest.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The form of a Circle.</span>And as the places where, so the manner how the Circles are to be drawn,
    ought to be perfectly known. First, for Infernal Spirits, let a Circle
    nine foot over be made with black, and within the same another Circle
    half a foot distant, leaving half a foot of both these Circles open
    for the Magitian and his assistant to enter in: And betwixt these
    Circles round about, write all the holy Names of God, with Crosses and
    Triangles at every Name; making also a larger triangle at one side of
    the Circle without on this manner with the names of the Trinity at
    the seven corners, <i>viz.</i> <span class="gothic">Yehowah</span>,*<span class="sni">[* sic]</span>
    <span class="gothic">Ruah Kedesh, Immanuel</span>, written in the little circles.</p>

  <div class="figright">
    <img src="images/i_564.png" width="120" height="68" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p><span class="sni">The reason of Circles.</span>The reason that Magitians give for Circles and their Institution, is,
    That so much ground being blessed and consecrated by holy Words, hath
    a secret force to expel all evil Spirits from the bounds thereof; and
    being sprinkled with holy water, which hath been blessed by the<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_473">473</span> Master,
    the ground is purified from all uncleanness; besides the holy Names of
    God written all about, whose force is very powerful; so that no wicked
    Spirit hath the ability to break through into the Circle after the
    Master and Scholler are entered, and have closed up the gap, by reason
    of the antipathy they possesse to these Mystical Names. And the reason
    of the Triangle is, that if the Spirit be not easily brought to speak
    the truth, they may by the Exorcist be conjured to enter the same,
    where by vertue of the names of the Sacred Trinity, they can speak
    nothing but what is true and right.</p>

  <p>But if Astral Spirits as Faries, Nymphs, and Ghosts of men, be called
    upon, the Circle must be made with Chalk, without any Triangles; in
    the place whereof the Magical Character of that Element to which they
    belong, must be described at the end of every Name./</p>

  <p class="subheadc"><i>How to raise up the Ghost of one that hath hanged himself.</i></p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THis experiment must be put in practice while the Carcass hangs; and
    therefore the Exorcist must seek out for the straightest hazel wand
    that he can find, to the top whereof he must binde the head of an Owl,
    with a bundle of <i>St. John’s Wort</i>, or <i>Milliès Perforatum</i>: this done,
    he must be informed of some miserable creature that hath strangled
    himself in some Wood or Desart place (which they seldom miss to do)
    and while the Carcass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
    hangs, the Magitian must betake himself to the
    aforesaid place, at 12 a clock at night, and begin his Conjurations in
    this following manner.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The ceremonies of Necromancy.</span>First, stretch forth the consecrated Wand towards the four corners
    of the World, saying, <i>By the mysteries of the deep, by the flames
    of</i> <span class="gothic">Banal</span>, <i>by the power of the</i> East, <i>and the silence of the
    night, by the holy rites of</i> <span class="gothic">Hecate</span>, <i>I conjure and exorcize
    thee thou distressed Spirit, to present thy self here, and reveal unto
    me the cause of thy Calamity, why thou didst offer violence to thy own
    liege life, where thou art now in beeing, and where thou wilt hereafter
    be</i>.</p>

  <p>Then gently smiting the Carcase nine times with the rod, say, <i>I
    conjure thee thou spirit of this</i> N. <i>deceased, to answer my demands
    that I am to propound unto thee, as thou ever hopest for the rest of
    the holy ones, and the ease of all thy misery; by the blood of Jesu
    which he shed for thy soul, I conjure and bind thee to utter unto me
    what I shall ask thee</i>.</p>

  <p>Then cutting down the Carcass from the tree, lay his head towards the
    East, and in the space that this following Conjuration is repeating,
    set a Chafing-dish of fire at his right hand, into which powre a
    little Wine, some Mastick, and Gum Aromatick, and lastly a viol full
    of the sweetest Oyl, having also a pair of Bellows, and some unkindled
    Charcole to make the fire burn bright at the instant of the Carcass’s
    rising. <span class="sni">The Conjuration.</span>The Conjuration is this:</p>

  <p><i>I conjure thee thou spirit of</i> N. <i>that thou do immediately enter into
    thy antient body again, and answer to my demands, by the virtue of the
    holy resurrection, and by the posture of the body of the Saviour of
    the world, I charge thee, I conjure thee, I command thee on pain of
    the torments and wandring of thrice seven years, which I by the power
    of sacred Magick rites, have power to inflict upon thee; by thy sighs
    and groans, I conjure thee to utter thy voice; so help thee God and the
    prayers of the holy Church. Amen.</i></p>

  <p>Which Conjuration being thrice repeated while the fire is burning with
    Mastick and Gum Aromatick, the body will begin to rise, and at last
    will stand upright before the Exorcist, <span class="sni">The answers of
    the Spirit.</span>answering with a faint and
    hollow voice, the questions proposed unto it. Why it strangled it self;
    where its dwelling is; what its food and life is; how long it will be
    ere it enter into rest, and by what means the Magitian may assist it
    to come to rest: Also, of the treasures of this world, where they are
    hid: Moreover, it can answer very punctually of the places where Ghosts
    reside, and how to communicate with them; teaching the nature of Astral
    Spirits and hellish beings, so far as its capacity reacheth.</p>

  <p>All which when the Ghost hath fully answered, the Magitian ought out
    of commiseration and reverence to the deceased,<span class="sni">How to lay the Spirit.</span> to use what means can
    possibly be used for the procuring rest unto the Spirit.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span> To which
    effect he must dig a grave, and filling the same half full of quick
    Lime, and a little Salt and common Sulphur, put the Carcass naked into
    the same; which experiment, next to the burning of the body into ashes,
    is of great force to quiet and end the disturbance of the Astral Spirit.</p>

  <p>But if the Ghost with whom the Exorcist consulteth, be of one that dyed
    the common death, and obtain’d the ceremonies of burial, the body must
    be dig’d out of the ground at 12 a clock at night; and the Magician
    must have a com/panion<span class="snp" id="pa_218"><b>218.</b></span> with him, who beareth a torch in his left hand,
    and smiting the Corps thrice with the consecrated rod, the Exorcist
    must turn himself to all the four winds, saying:</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Another form.</span><i>By the virtue of the holy resurrection, and the torments of the
    damned, I conjure and exorcize thee spirit of</i> N. <i>deceased, to answer
    my liege demands, being obedient unto these sacred ceremonies on pain
    of everlasting torment and distress</i>: Then let him say, <span class="gothic">Berald,
    Beroald, Balbin gab gabor agaba</span>; <i>Arise, arise, I charge and
    command thee</i>.</p>

  <p>After which Ceremonies, let him ask what he desireth and he shall be
    answered.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">A Caution for the Exorcist.</span>But as a faithful caution to the practicer of this Art, I shall
    conclude with this, That if the Magician, by the Constellation and
    Position of the Stars at his nativity, be in the predicament of those
    that follow Magical Arts, it will be very dangerous to try this
    experiment for fear of suddain death ensuing, which the Ghosts of men
    deceased, can easily effect upon those whose nativities lead them to
    Conjuration: And which suddain and violent death, the Stars do alwayes
    promise to such as they mark with the <i>Stigma</i> of Magicians.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THe <span class="sni">Their order.</span>Spirit <i>Paymon</i> is of the power of the Air, the sixteenth in the
    ranck of Thrones, subordinate to <i>Corban</i> and <i>Marbas</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Bathin</i> is of a deeper reach in the source of the fire, the second
    after <i>Lucifers</i> familiar, and hath not his fellow for agility and
    affableness, in the whole Infernal Hierarchy.</p>

  <p><i>Barma</i> is a mighty Potentate of the order of <i>Seraphims</i>, whom 20

    the Magician or whom he pleaseth, and transport into foreign Countreys.</p>

  <p>These three Spirits, though of various ranks and orders, are all of
    one power, ability and nature, and the form of raising them all is
    one. Therefore the Magician that desireth to consult with either of
    these Spirits, must appoint a night in the waxing of the Moon, wherein
    the Planet <i>Mercury</i> reigns, at 11 a clock at night; not joyning to
    himself any companion, because this particular action will admit of
    none; and for the space of four dayes before the appointed night,<span class="sni">The Utensils to be used.</span> he
    ought every morning to shave his beard, and shift himself with clean
    linnen, providing beforehand the two Seals of the Earth, drawn exactly
    upon parchment, having also his consecrated Girdle ready of a black
    Cats skin with the hair on, and these names written on the inner
    side of the Girdle: <span class="gothic">Ya, Ya</span> ✠ <span class="gothic">Aie,

    ✠ <span class="gothic">Yah Adonay</span> ✠ <i>tuo robore</i> ✠
    <i>Cinctus sum</i> ✠.</p>

  <p>Upon his Shooes must be written <span class="gothic">Tetragrammaton</span>, with crosses
    round about, and his garment must be a Priestly Robe of black, with a
    Friers hood, and a Bible in his hand.</p>

  <p>When all these things are prepared, and the Exorcist hath lived
    chastly, and retired until the appointed time: Let him have ready
    a fair Parlour or Cellar, with every chink and window closed; then
    lighting seven Candles,<span class="sni">The Circle.</span> and drawing a double Circle with his own
    blood, which he must have ready before hand: let him divide the Circle
    into seven parts, and write these seven names at the seven divisions,
    setting at every Name a Candle lighted in a brazen Candlestick in
    the space betwixt the Circles: The names are these, <span class="gothic">Cados</span> ✠

  <p><span class="snp"><b>219.</b></span>When the Candles are lighted, let the Magician being in the midst of
    the Circle, and supporting himself with two drawn Swords, say with a
    low and submissive voyce; <span class="sni">The Consecration.</span><i>I do by the vertue of these seven holy Names

    enter not on pain of torments to be doubled</i>, <span class="gothic">Yah, Agion, Helior,
    Heligah</span>, <i>Amen</i>.</p>

  <p>When this Consecration is ended, Let him sprinkle the Circle with
    consecrated Water, and with a Chafing-dish of Charcole, perfume it with
    Frankincense and Cinamon, laying the Swords a cross the Circle, and
    standing over them; then whilest the fumigation burneth, let him begin
    to call these three Spirits in this following manner:</p>

    Northern quarter of this Circle, all of you, or any one of you, and
    answer my demands by the force of the words contained in this Book.</i>
    This must be thrice repeated, and at the third repetition, the three
    Spirits will either all appear, or one by lot, if the other be already
    somewhere else imployed; at their appearance they will send before them
    <span class="sni">The Appearanees. [<i>sic</i>]</span>three fleet Hounds opening after a Hare, who will run round the Circle

    Hare from their ravenous mouths, and together with the Hounds vanish;
    at last the Magician shall hear the winding of a Hunts-mans horn, and
    a Herald on Horseback shall come galloping with three Hunters behind
    upon black Horses, who will compass the Circle seven times, and at the
    seventh time will make a stand at the Northern quarter, dismissing the
    Herald that came up before them, and turning their Horses towards the
    Magician, will stand all a brest before him, saying; <span class="gothic">Gil pragma

  <p class="drop-cap">COnsecrations <span class="sni">What things are to be consecrated.</span>are related either to the person or the thing
    consecrated. The person is the Magitian himself, whose consecration
    consisteth in Abstinence, Temperance, and holy Garments. The things
    consecrated are the Oyl, the Fire, the Water. The Fumigations
    consisting of oriental Gums and Spices; the magical Sword, Pensils,
    Pens and Compasses, the measuring Rule
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span> and waxen Tapers, the
    Pentacles, Periapts, Lamins, and Sigils, Vests, Caps, and Priestly
    Garments; these are the materials to be consecrated.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Pentacles.</span>The sacred Pentacles are as signs and charms for the binding of Evil
    Dæmons, consisting of Characters and Names of the Superior order of the
    good Spirits opposite unto those evil ones whom the Magitian is about
    to Invocate: And of sacred Pictures, Images, and Mathematical Figures
    adapted to the names and natures of separated Substances whither good
    or evil. Now the form of Consecrating such Magical Pentacles is to
    name the vertue of the holy Names and Figures, their Antiquity and
    Institution with the intention of the Consecration purifying the
    Pentacle by consecrated fire, and waving the same over the flames
    thereof.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Utensils.</span>When the Exorcist would consecrate Places or Utensils, Fire or Water
    for magical uses, he must repeat the Consecration or Dedication of
    <i>Solomon</i> the King at the building of the Temple, the Vision of
    <i>Moses</i> at the Bush, and the Spirit of the Lord on the tops of the
    Mulberry-trees, repeating also the sacrifice of it self being kindled;
    the Fire upon <i>Sodom</i>, and the Water of Eternal Life: Wherein the
    Magitian must still remember to speak of the seven golden Candlesticks,
    and <i>Ezekiels</i> Wheels, closing the Consecration with the deep and
    mysterious Names of God and holy Dæmons.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Instruments.</span>When particular Instruments are to be sanctified, the Magitian must
    sprinkle the same with consecrated Water, and fumigate them with
    fumigations, anoint them with consecrated Oyl: And lastly, Seal them
    with holy/<span class="snp" id="pa_221"><b>221.</b></span> Characters; after all which is performed, an Oration or
    Prayer must follow, relating the particulars of the Consecration with
    Petitions to that Power in whose Name and Authority the Ceremony is
    performed.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">How to consecrate.</span>And in like manner shalt thou consecrate and sanctifie every Utensil

    two Testaments in the New Covenant, of the holy Prophets in their
    Mothers wombs, and of <i>Aholiah</i>, and <i>Aholibah</i>, whom the Spirit of God

  <p class="subhead"><i>Treating more practically of the Consecration of Circles,
    Fires, Garments, and Fumigations.</i></p>

  <p class="drop-cap">IN <span class="sni">Circles how to be made.</span>the Construction of Magical Circles, the hour, day, or night, and
    season of the year, and the Constellation are to be considered; as
    also what sort of Spirits are to be called; and to what Region, Air,
    or Climate they belong: Therefore this method is to be followed for
    the more orderly and certain proceeding therein. First, a Circle nine
    foot over must be drawn, within which another Circle three inches from
    the outermost must be also made, in the Center whereof the name of the
    hour, the Angel of the hour, the Seal of the Angel, the Angel of the
    day predominant, wherein the work is undertaken. Note, these attributes
    are to be inscribed betwixt the Circles round about with <i>Alpha</i> at the
    beginning, and <i>Omega</i> at the close.</p>

  <p>When the Circle is composed, it must be sprinkled with holy Water,
    while the Magician saith,<span class="sni">Fumigations.</span> <i>Wash me O Lord, and I shall be whiter
    then Snow</i>: And as for the Fumigations over them, this Benediction
    must be said; <i>O God of</i> Abraham, Isaac, <i>and</i> Jacob, <i>bless these
    thy subservient creatures, that they may multiply the force of their
    excellent odors, to hinder evil spirits and phantasms from entring the
    Circle, through our Lord. Amen.</i></p>

  <h4><i>An Exorcism for the fire.</i></h4>

  <p><span class="sni">Fire.</span>The Exorcist ought to have an earthen Censer, wherein to preserve
    the fire for magical uses, and the expiations and fumigations, whose
    consecration is on this manner.</p>

  <p><i>By him that created Heaven and Earth, and is the God and Lord of all,
    I exorcize and sanctifie thee thou creature of Fire, that immediately
    thou banish every phantasm from thee, so that thou prove not hurtful
    in any kind: Which I beseech thee O Lord to confirm by sanctifying
    and making pure this creature of fire, that it may be blessed and
    consecrate to the honour of thy holy Name. Amen.</i></p>

  <h4><i>At the putting on the Garments,</i></h4>

  <p class="drop-cap">THe <span class="sni">What sort of Garments must be used.</span>Garment which the Exorcist is cloathed withall at the performance
    of this action, ought according to the opinions of the chiefest
    Magicians, to be a Priestly Robe, which if it can no where be procured,
    may be a neat and cleanly linnen Vest, with the holy Pentacle fastned
    thereunto upon Parchment made of a Kids skin, over which an Invocation
    must be said, and then the Pentacle must be sprinkled with holy Water.
    At the putting on the Magical Garment, this Prayer must be repeated:
    <i>By thy holy power</i> <span class="gothic">Adonai Sabaoth</span>, <i>And by the power and merit
    of thine Angels and Archangels, and by the vertue of holy Church, which
    thou hast sanctified, do I cloath me with this consecrated Garment,
    that what I am to practice may take effect through thy Name who art for
    ever and ever.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sni">The manner of Conjuring.</span>Now as for the time of operation, and the manner thereof, The
    Instructions before set down, are sufficient to direct the Exorcist;
    only the Acter and his Scholar must be mindful in the way, as they go
    towards the place of Conjuration, to reiterate the sacred forms of
    Consecrations, Prayers, and Invocations, the one bearing an Earthen
    Vessel with consecrated fire, and the other the Magical Sword, the Book
    and Garments, till approaching nigh the place where the Circle is to be
    drawn, they must then proceed to compose it after the aforesaid manner.
    And at last Exorcize the Spirits on this following manner:</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The form.</span><i>Seeing God hath given us the power to bruise the Serpents head, and
    command the Prince of Darkness, much more to bear rule over every
    airy Spirit: Therefore by his strong and mighty Name</i> <span class="gothic">Jehovah</span>
    <i>do I conjure you</i>, (naming the Spirits), <i>and by his secret
    commands delivered to</i> Moses <i>on the Mount, and by his holy Name</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
    <span class="gothic">Tetragrammaton</span>, <i>and by all his wonderful Names and Attributes</i>,

    you, unless you speedily fulfil my commands</i>, <span class="gothic">Bathar, Baltar,
    Archim, Anakim, Nakun</span>. <i>Amen.</i></p>

  <p>When the Exorcist hath finished this Conjuration, he and his companion
    shall continue constantly turning themselves to the East, West, North
    and South, <span class="sni">The Apparitions.</span>saying, with their Caps in their hands, <span class="gothic">Gerson, Anek,
    Nephaton, Basannah, Cabon</span>; and within a little space they will
    behold various apparitions upon the ground, and in the air, with
    various habits, shapes, and instruments; after that, he shall perceive
    a troop of armed men with threatning carriage appear before the Circle,
    who after they are conjured to leave off their phantasms, will at last
    present themselves before the Exorcist in humane form.</p>

  <p>Then the Master must be mindful to take the consecrated Sword, and the
    cup of Wine into his hands; the Wine he shall pour into the fire, and
    the Sword he shall brandish in his right arm, being girded about with a
    Scarlet Ribbon; after this the Magician shall say, <span class="gothic">Gahire, Gephna,
    Anepheraton</span>; then the Spirits will begin to bow unto the Exorcist,
    saying, <i>We are ready to fulfil thy pleasure</i>.</p>

  <p>So that when the Magician hath brought the Spirits to this length, he
    may ask what ever he desireth, and they will answer him, provided the
    questions belong to that order whereof they are.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">What these Spirits can do.</span>Now the properties wherein they excel, are these; They can give the
    gift of Invisibility, and the fore-knowledge of the change of weather;
    they can teach the Exorcist how to excite Storms and Tempests, and
    how to calm them again; they can bring news in an hours space of the
    success of any Battle, Seidge, or Navy, how farr off soever; they
    can also teach the language of Birds, and how to fly through the air
    invisibly./</p>

  <p><span class="snp" id="pa_223"><b>223.</b></span><span class="sni">An example of their power.</span>
    ’Twas through the assistance of these airy Spirits, that
    <i>Chanchiancungi</i>, the <i>Tartarian</i> Emperour did give the <i>Chinois</i> such
    a desperate rout near the year 1646. for it is reported, that he had
    constantly in his presence two Magicians, named <i>Ran</i> and <i>Sionam</i>, who
    perceived every motion of the <i>China</i>’s Army, and had intelligence by
    these Spirits of the Emperours private Counsels and Consultations.</p>

  <p>And it is credibly reported by Magicians, that wonderful things may
    be with facility effected through the assistance of these aforesaid
    Spirits, so that the Exorcist must be very affable unto them, and
    gently dismiss them (when he is satisfied) in this following manner;</p>

  <p><span class="sni">How to dismiss them.</span><i>Seeing ye have willingly answered all our Interrogations and desires,
    we give you leave and licence, In the Name of the Father, Son,

    call; Depart, I say, in peace, and peace be confirmed betwixt us and
    you. Amen.</i> ✠ ✠ ✠.</p>

  <p>After all these Ceremonies are finished, the Spirits will begin to
    depart, making obeysance as they go; and then the Master must demolish
    the Circle, and taking up all the Utensils repeat the <i>Pater Noster</i> as

  <p class="drop-cap">ACcording <span class="sni">How to consult with <i>Familiars</i> or <i>Genii</i>.</span>
    to the former Instructions in conjuring Spirits, we must
    proceed to consult with the <i>Familiars</i> or <i>Genii</i>; first, after the
    manner prescribed by Magicians, the Exorcist must inform himself of
    the <i>name</i> of his good <i>Genius</i>, which he may find in the Rules of
    <i>Travius</i> and <i>Philermus</i>; as also, what <i>Character</i> and <i>Pentacle</i>, or
    <i>Lamin</i>, belongs to every <i>Genius</i>. After this is done, Let him compose
    an earnest Prayer unto the said <i>Genius</i>, which he must repeat thrice
    every morning for seven dayes before the Invocation.</p>

  <p>The Magician must also perfectly be informed to what Hierarchy or
    Order the <i>Genius</i> belongs, and how he is dignified in respect of his
    Superiours and Inferiours; for this form of Conjuration belongs not to
    the Infernal or Astral Kingdom, but to the Celestial Hierarchy; and
    therefore great gravity and sanctity is herein required, besides the
    due observation of all the other injunctions, until the time approach
    wherein he puts the Conjuration in execution.</p>

  <p>When the day is come wherein the Magician would invocate his proper
    <i>Genius</i>, he must enter into a private closet, having a little Table
    and Silk Carpet, and two Waxen Candles lighted; as also a Chrystal
    Stone shaped triangularly about the quantity of an Apple, which Stone
    must be fixed upon a frame in the center of the Table: And then
    proceeding with great devotion to Invocation, he must thrice repeat
    the former Prayer, concluding the same with <i>Pater Noster, &amp;c.</i> and a
    <i>Missale de Spiritu Sancto</i>.</p>

  <p>Then he must begin to Consecrate the Candles, Carpet, Table and
    Chrystal; sprinkling the same with his own blood, and saying, <i>I do
    by the power of the holy Names</i> <span class="gothic">Aglaon, Eloi, Eloi, Sabbathon,
    Anepheraton, Jah, Agian, Jah, Jehovah, Immanuel, Archon Archonton,

  <p><span class="sni">The Prayer.</span>Which done, the Exorcist must say this following Prayer with his face
    towards the East, and kneeling with his back to the consecrated Table.</p>

  <p><i>O thou blessed</i> <span class="gothic">Phanael</span> <i>my Angel Guardian, vouchsafe to
    descend with thy holy Influence and presence into this spotless
    Chrystal, that I may behold thy glory and enjoy thy society O thou

    art mighty and potent in thy celestial and super-lunary motion, do
    thou descend and be present I pray thee, and desire thee, if ever I
    have merited thy society, or if my actions and intentions be pure
    and sanctified before thee, bring thy external presence hither, and
    converse with thy submissive Pupil, by the tears of Saints and Songs of
    Angels, In the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who are one God
    for ever and ever.</i></p>

  <p>This Prayer being first repeated towards the East, must be afterwards
    said towards all the four winds thrice. And next the 70. Psalm repeated
    out of a Bible that hath been consecrated in like manner as the rest of
    the utensils; which ceremonies being seriously performed; the Magician
    must arise from his knees, and sit before the Crystal bare-headed with
    the consecrated Bible in his hand, and the Waxen Candles newly lighted,
    waiting patiently and internally for the coming and appearance of the
    <i>Genius</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Signs of the appearance</span>Now about a quarter of an hour before the Spirit come. There will
    appear great variety of apparitions and sights within the glass; as
    first a beaten road or tract, and travelers, men and women marching
    silently along; next there will Rivers, Wells, Mountains and Seas
    appear: after that a Shepherd upon a pleasant hill feeding a goodly
    flock of Sheep, and the Sun shining brightly at his going down; and
    lastly, innumerable shews of Birds and Beasts, Monsters and strange
    appearances, noises, glances, and affrightments, which shews will all
    at last vanish at the appearance of the <i>Genius</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The Appearance</span>And then the <i>Genius</i> will present it self amidst the Crystal, in the
    very same apparel and similitude that the person himself is in, giving
    instructions unto the Exorcist how to lead his life and rectifie his
    doings.</p>

  <p>But especially (which is the proper work of every <i>Genius</i>) he will
    touch his heart and open his senses and understanding, so that by this
    means, he may attain to the knowledge of every Art and Science, which
    before the opening of his Intellect was lockt and kept secret from him.</p>

  <p>After which, the <i>Genius</i> will be familiar in the Stone at the Prayer
    of the Magician.</p>

    <i>Northern</i> parts of <i>Russia</i>, bordering on the <i>Northern</i> frozen Ocean:
    His office (being called by Magicians) is to demolish strong holds
    of Enemies, destroying every night what they build the day before;
    to extinguish fires, and make their Gunshot that it hath no power to
    be enkindled; for his nature is to be at enmity with fire: and under
    his Master with many Legions he wageth continual warrs with the fiery
    Spirits that inhabit the Mountain <i>Hecla</i> in <i>Ise-land</i>, where they
    endeavour to extinguish these fiery flames, and the inhabiting Spirits
    defend the flames from his Master and his Legions./</p>

  <p><span class="snp"><b>225.</b></span><span class="sni">The Warrs of Spirits.</span>
    In this contest they do often totally extirpate and destroy one
    another, killing and crushing when they meet in mighty and violent
    Troops in the Air upon the Sea; and at such a time many of the fiery
    Spirits are destroyed, when the Enemy hath brought them off the
    Mountain to fight upon the water; on the contrary, when the battle is
    on the Mountain it self, the Spirits of the Air are often worsted, and

    <span class="gothic">Luridan</span>.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">AS in the former Chapter, the Exorcist is instructed to draw the
    form of the Mountain <i>Hecla</i> within the circle, so in this form of
    Conjuration he must do the same, adding these names to be written
    round the Mountain <span class="sni">The names of Olympick Angels.</span>
    <i>Mathiel</i>; <span class="gothic">Rahuniel, Seraphiel, Hyniel, Rayel,
    Fraciel</span>. These are the names of <i>Olympick Angels</i>, governing the
    <i>North</i>, and ruling over every airy Spirit that belongs unto the
    <i>Northern</i> Climate; so that the authority of these names must be used
    in the calling up of this Spirit, because he is a great Lord, and very
    lofty, neither will he appear without strong and powerful Invocations.</p>

  <p>Therefore the Magician must make upon Virgin Parchment the two Seals
    of the Earth, and provide unto himself a Girdle made of a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span> Bears skin
    with a rough side next his body, and these names wrote round about in

    Priestly Robe to reach to his ankles, and a new Sword with <span class="gothic">Agla</span>
    on the one side, and <span class="gothic">On</span> upon the other; having likewise been
    very continent and chast for three days before the execution of his

    him an earthen pan with fire therein, and a little Viol with some of
    his own blood, as also some of the Gum or Rozin that comes from the
    Firr-tree.</p>

  <p>And coming to the appointed place in some solitary Valley, the circle
    must be drawn with chalk, as the former, one circle within another, and
    these powerful names in the circumference, <span class="gothic">Otheos on Panthon</span>

  <p>This Circumscription is accounted amongst Magicians of all the most
    powerful and prevalent.</p>

  <p>After this the Circle, Mountain, Fire, Turpentine, Girdle, Garments,
    Sword and Blood must be consecrated according to the foregoing forms of

    this consecrated Circle, to answer my proposals and desires without any
    manner of terrible form either of thy self, or attendants; but only
    obediently, fairly, and with good intent, to present thy self before
    me, this Circle being my defence, through his power who is Almighty,
    and hath sanctified the same, In the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy
    Ghost. Amen.</i></p>

  <p>After the Magician hath thrice repeated this Conjuration, Let him
    immediately set the fire before him, and put the Rozin thereon to
    fumigate at the appearance of the conjured Spirits, and at the instant
    of their appearance he shall hold the Censer of fire in his left hand,
    and the Sword in his right, still turning round as the Spirits do.</p>

  <p>For in a little space after the Invocation is repeated, he shall hear
    the noise of Thunders, and perceive before him in the Valley a mighty
    storm of Lightning and Rain; after a while the same will cease, and
    an innumerable company of Dwarfs or Pigmies will appear mounted upon
    Chamelions to march towards the Circle surrounding the same.</p>

  <p>Next comes <span class="gothic">Balkin</span> with his Attendants; he will appear like the
    god <i>Bacchus</i> upon a little Goat, and the rest that follow will march
    after him afoot.</p>

  <p>Assoon as they come near the Circle, they will breath out of their
    mouths a mist, or fog, which will even obscure the light of the Moon,
    and darken the Magician, that he cannot behold them nor himself; yet
    let him not be discomfited, or afraid, for that fog will be quickly
    over; and the Spirits will run round the Circle after <span class="gothic">Balkin</span>
    their Lord, who rides upon a Goat; they will continue to surround the
    Circle, till the Magician begin the form of obligation or binding their
    Leader or King in this form, with the Sword in his right hand, the Fire
    and Rozin burning before him.</p>

  <p><i>I conjure and bind thee</i> <span class="gothic">Balkin</span>, <i>who art appeared before
    me, by the Father, by the Son, and by the Holy Ghost, by all the
    holy Consecrations I have made, by the powerful Names of Heaven,
    and of Earth, and of Hell, that I have used and uttered in calling
    upon thee, by the Seals which thou here beholdest, and the Sword
    which I present</i>*<span class="sni">[* show, not give]</span> <i>unto thee, by this sanctified Girdle, and all

    <i>aforesaid, That here thou remain
    peaceably, and of thy present shape before the Northern quarter of
    this Circle, without injury to me in body, soul, or fortune; but on
    the contrary, to answer faithfully unto my demands, and not hence to
    remove, till I have licenced thee to depart, In the Name of the Father,
    Son, and holy Spirit. Amen.</i>/</p>

  <p><span class="snp"><b>228.</b></span>When he is thus obliged, he will alight from his Goat, and cause his
    Attendants to remove further into the Valley, then will he stand
    peaceably before the Circle to answer the Magician.</p>

  <p>After this the Magician shall begin to demand into his own possession
    a Familiar to build or pull down any Castle or strong hold in a night;
    and that this Familiar bring with him the Girdle of Conquest, or
    Victory, that the Magician being girded with the same may overcome all
    enemies whatsoever,</p>

  <p>And further, the Spirit is able to inform him of all questions
    concerning Thunder and Lightning, the Motions of the Heavens, the
    Comets and Apparitions in the air, Pestilence and Famine, noxious and
    malevolent blasts, as also of the Inhabitants of the <i>Northern</i> Pole,
    and the wonders undiscovered throughout the world.</p>

  <p>Likewise if the Exorcist inquire concerning the habitations of starry
    Spirits, he will readily answer him, describing their orders, food,
    life, and pasttime truly and exactly.</p>

  <p>After the Magician hath satisfied himself with inquiries, and curious
    questions unto the Spirit, there will come from amongst the company a
    little Spirit of a span long, like a little <i>Ethiop</i>, which the great
    King <span class="gothic">Balkin</span> will deliver unto the Exorcist to continue as a
    Familiar with him as long as his life shall last. This familiar the
    possessor may name at*<span class="sni">[* as]</span> it pleaseth him.</p>

  <p>The three last, who had this Spirit into possession, were three
    <i>Northern</i> Magicians, the first <i>Honduros</i> a <i>Norwegian</i>, who called it
    <span class="gothic">Philenar</span>, and commanded it at his pleasure with a little Bell.</p>

  <p>After him <i>Benno</i> his eldest Son injoy’d the same under the same name.</p>

  <p>And <i>Swarkzar</i> a <i>Polonian</i> Priest was the last who enjoy’d it under
    the Name of <span class="gothic">Muncula</span>; all which names were imposed upon it,
    according to the pleasure of the Masters; and therefore the naming of
    this familiar is left to the discretion of the Exorcist.</p>

  <p>Now when the Master hath taken this familiar into his custody and
    service, the Spirit <span class="gothic">Balkin</span> will desire to depart, being wearied
    if the action continue longer then an hour. Therefore the Magician must
    be careful to dismiss him in this following form:</p>

  <p><i>Because thou hast diligently answered my demands, and been ready to
    come at my first call, I do here licence thee to depart unto thy proper
    place, without injury or danger to man or Beast; depart, I say, and </i>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span><i>be ever ready at my call, being duly exorcized and conjured by sacred
    Rites of Magick; I charge thee to withdraw with quiet and peace; and
    peace be continued betwixt me and thee, In the Name of the Father, Son,
    and Holy Ghost. Amen.</i></p>

  <p>Then the Spirits company will begin to march about their Prince, and
    in a formal Troop will march along the Valley, whilest the Magician
    repeateth <i>Pater Noster</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> until the Spirits be quite out of sight
    and vanished.</p>

  <p>This is a compleat form of conjuring the aforesaid Spirit, according to
    the Rules of <i>Vaganostus</i> the <i>Norwegian</i>.</p>

    Also how farr the Power of Magitians and Witches is able to
    operate in Diabolical Magick.</i></p>

  <p class="drop-after">
    <span class="drop-after"><span class="vat">1.</span><img src="images/drop_b.png" width="75" height="75" alt='B' /></span>Ecause
    <span class="sni">The reason of this Addition.</span>the Author in his foregoing Treatise, upon the <i>Nature
    of Spirits and Devils</i>, hath only touched the subject thereof
    superficially, omitting the more material part; and with a brief and
    cursory Tractat, hath concluded to speak the least of this subject
    which indeed requires most amply to be illustrated; therefore I thought
    fit to adjoyn this subsequent discourse; as succedaneous to the
    fore-going, and conducing to the compleating of the whole work.</p>

  <p class="clear"><span class="sni">The nature of Spirits.</span>2. The Nature of Spirits is variously to be considered, according
    to the source to which each <i>Caterva</i> doth belong: for as some are
    altogether of a divine and celestial nature; not subject to the
    abominable Inchantments and Conjurations of vitious mankind; so
    others are the grand Instigators, stirring up mans heart to attempt
    the enquiry after the darkest, and most mysterious part of Magick, or
    Witchcraft: neither is this their suggestion without its secret end:
    that is, that by the private insinuation, and as it were incorporating
    themselves into the affection, or desire of the Witch, or Magician;
    they may totally convert him into their own nature: reducing him at
    last by constant practice, to such obdurateness and hardness of heart,
    that he becometh one with them, and delighted with their association,
    being altogether dead to any motions in himself that may be called good.</p>

  <p>3. And if we may credit example, which is the surest proof; the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span> very
    <span class="sni">The original of evil essences.</span>
    imaginations, and affection of a Magician, doth create an evil Essence
    or Devil; which was not before in being: for, as the Astral Spirits are
    believed by many to Germinate and procreate one another, so likewise
    are the infernal Spirits capable of multiplication in their power and
    essence, according to their Orders, Ranks and Thrones; by means of the
    strong imagination in a Witch, or malevolous person, earnestly desiring
    their assistance.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their Germination.</span>4. Not that the Spirits or Devils so begotten do any whit add or
    contribute to the number in general; for as they are capable of
    increasing into distinct and separated substances, so are they likewise
    again contracted, and as it were annihilated; when the force of that
    Imagination is gone, which was the cause of their production: The
    nature of a spirit, whither heavenly or hellish, being to dilate, or
    contract themselves into as narrow compass, as they please; so that in
    a moment they can be as big in circumference as an hundred worlds, and
    on a sodain reduce themselves to the compass of an atome.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their Habitation.</span>5. Neither are they somuch limited as Tradition would have them; for
    they are not at all shut up in any separated place: but can remove
    millions of miles in the twinkling of an eye, yet are they still where
    they were at first: for, out of their own element, or quality, they can
    never come: go whither they will, they are in darkness: and the cause
    is within them, not without them: as one whose mind is troubled here in
    <i>England</i>, can remove/<span class="snp"><b>40.</b></span> his Carcase from the place where it was before;
    but should he go to the utmost bounds of the Earth, he cannot leave his
    perplexed and tormented minde behind him.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their shapes.</span>6. As for the shapes and various likenesses of Devils, It is generally
    believed, that according to their various capacities in wickedness,
    so their shapes are answerable after a Magical manner: resembling
    spiritually some horrid and ugly monsters, as their conspiracies
    against the power of God, were high and monstrous, when they fell from
    Heaven: for the condition of some of them is nothing but continual
    horrour and despair; others triumph in firie might and pomp, attempting
    to pluck God from out of his Throne; but the quality of Heaven is shut
    from them, that they can never find it, which doth greatly add to their
    torment and misery.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their place of pleasure or torment.</span>
    7. But that they are materially vexed and scorched in flames of fire,
    is inferiour to any to give credit to, who is throughly verst in their
    nature and existence: for their substance is spiritual; yea their
    power is greater, then to be detain’d or tormented with any thing
    without them: doubtless their misery is sufficiently great, but not
    through outward flames; for their Bodies are able to pierce through
    Wood and Iron, Stone, and all Terrestrial things: Neither is all the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
    fire, or fewel of this World able to torment them; for in a moment
    they can pierce it through and through. But the infinite source of
    their misery is in themselves, and is continually before them, so that
    they can never enjoy any rest, being absent from the presence of God:
    which torment is greater to them, then all the tortures of this world
    combin’d together.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The cause of their torment.</span>8. The wicked souls that are departed this life, are also capable
    of appearing again, and answering the Conjurations of Witches, and
    Magicians, for a time: according to <i>Nagar</i> the <i>Indian</i>, and the
    <i>Pythagoreans</i>. And it cannot be easily conceived, that their torment
    is much different from the rest of the Devils: for the Scripture saith:
    <i>every one is rewarded according to their works</i>. And, <i>that which a
    man sows, that he shall reap</i>. Now as the damned Spirits, when they
    lived on earth, did heap up vanity, and load their souls with iniquity,
    as a treasure to carry with them into that Kingdom, which sin doth
    naturally lead into: so when they are there, the same abominations
    which here they committed, do they ruminate and feed upon; and the
    greater they have been, the greater is the torment, that ariseth before
    them every moment.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">How Magicians deal with them.</span>9. And although these Infernal Spirits, are open Enemies to the very
    means which God hath appointed for mans salvation; yet such is the
    degenerate and corrupted mind of mankind, that there is in the same
    an itching after them for converse and familiarity, to procure their
    assistance, in any thing that their vain imagination suggesteth them
    with: to effect which, they inform themselves in every Tradition of
    Conjuration and Exorcism; as also in the names, natures and powers of
    Devils in general, and are ever restless, till their souls be totally
    devoted to that accursed and detestable nature, which is at enmity with
    God and goodness.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The Orders of heavenly Beings.</span>10. Now to proceed in the description of these Infernal Spirits and
    separated <i>Dæmons</i>, or <i>Astral Beings</i>, as also of those in the
    Angelical Kingdom; they that pertain to the Kingdom of Heaven, are
    either Angels which are divided into their degrees and orders; or else
    the righteous souls departed, who are entred into rest: And it cannot
    be, but that the life of Angels and Souls departed, is the same in
    Heaven, as also the food that nourisheth them, and the fruits that
    spring before them: Nor is it possible for any, how expert so ever in
    Magical Arts, to compel either of them, of what degree soever they
    be, to present themselves, or appear before them: Although many have
    written large Discourses and Forms of Convocation, to compel the Angels
    unto communication with them by Magical Rites and Ceremonies.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">That they are not subject to conjurations.</span>11. It may indeed be believed, that seeing there are infinite numbers
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
    of Angels, they are also imployed for the glory of God, and protection
    of man/kind,<span class="snp"><b>41.</b></span> (but not subject to Conjurations:) And that they accompany
    many righteous men Invisibly, and protect Cities and Countries
    from Plagues, War, and infestings of wicked Spirits, against which
    Principalities and Powers of Darkness, it is their place to contend and
    war, to the confusion of the Kingdom of Darkness.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">What Spirits may be conjured.</span>12. But such Spirits as belong to this outward World, and are of the
    Elemental quality, subject to a beginning and ending, and to degrees
    of continuance; These may be solicited by Conjurations, and can also
    inform Magicians in all the secrets of Nature; yet so darkly, (because
    they want the outward organ); that it is hardly possible for any that
    hath fellowship with them, to learn any manual operation perfectly and
    distinctly from them.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The nature of the Astral Spirits.</span>13. Many have insisted upon the Natures of these Astral Spirits: some
    alledging, <i>That they are part of the faln Angels, and consequently
    subject to the torments of Hell at the last Judgment</i>: Others, <i>That
    they are the departed souls of men and women, confined to these outward
    Elements until the Consummation</i>: Lastly, others, As <i>Del rio</i>, <i>Nagar</i>
    the <i>Indian</i> Magician, and the <i>Platonists</i> affirm, <i>That their nature
    is middle between Heaven and Hell; and that they reign in a third
    Kingdom from both, having no other judgment or doom to expect for ever</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their degrees.</span>14. But to speak more nearly unto their natures, they are of the source
    of the Stars, and have their degrees of continuance, where of*<span class="sni">[* whereof]</span>
    some live hundreds, some thousands of years: Their food is the <i>Gas</i>
    of the Water, and the <i>Blas</i> of the Air: And in their Aspects, or
    countenances, they differ as to vigour and cheerfulness: They occupy
    various places of this world; as Woods, Mountains, Waters, Air, fiery
    Flames, Clouds, Starrs, Mines, and hid Treasures: as also antient
    Buildings, and places of the slain. Some again are familiar in Houses,
    and do frequently converse with, and appear unto mortals.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their actions and affections</span>
    15. They are capable of hunger, grief, passion, and vexation: they have
    not any thing in them that should bring them unto God: being meerly
    composed of the most spiritual part of the Elemeuts†:<span class="sni">[† n <i>reversed</i>]</span> And when
    they are worn out, they return into their proper essence or primary
    quality again; as Ice when it is resolved into Water: They meet in
    mighty Troops, and wage warr one with another: They do also procreate
    one another; and have power sometimes to make great commotions in the
    Air, and in the Clowds, and also to cloath themselves with visible
    bodies, out of the four Elements, appearing in Companies upon Hills
    and Mountains, and do often deceive and delude the observers of
    Apparitions, who take such for portents of great alterations, which are
    nothing but the sports and pastime of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>these frolick Spirits: as Armies
    in the Air, Troops marching on the Land, noises and slaughter, Tempest
    and Lightning, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sni">The distinct orders of starry Spirits.</span>16. These Astral Spirits are variously to be considered; some are
    beings separate and absolute, that are not constitute to any work or
    service: Others are subservient to the Angels that have dominion over
    the Influences of the Stars: Others are the Astral Spirits of men
    departed, which (if the party deceased was disturbed and troubled at
    his decease,) do for many years, continue in the source of this world;
    amongst these airy Spirits, to the great disquietness of the soul of
    the person, to whom they belong: Besides the causes are various that
    such Spirits rest not; 1. When by Witchcraft they are inchanted, and
    bound to wander so many years; as thrice or fourtimes seven, before
    they can be resolved into nothing. 2. When the person hath been
    murthered; so that the Spirit can never be at rest, till the crime be
    discovered. 3. When desires and lusts, after Wife, or Children, House,
    Lands, or Money, is very strong at their departure; it is a certain
    truth, that this same spirit belonging to the Starrs will be hanckering
    after these things, and drawn back by the strong desires and fixation
    of the Imagination, which is left behind it: Nor can it ever be at
    rest, till the thing be accomplished, for which it is disturbed. 4.
    When Treasure hath been hid, or any secret thing hath been commit/ted<span class="snp" id="pa_42"><b>42.</b></span>
    by the party; there is a magical cause of something attracting the
    starry spirit back again, to the manifestation of that thing. Upon all
    which, the following Chapters do insist more largely and particularly.</p>

    or evil <i>Dæmon</i> that accompanies the party visibly, or invisibly;
    and these are of such rancks and orders, and names, as the capacity
    of the persons soul is, to whom they belong: Their Office is said to
    be, fore-warning the person of eminent danger, sometimes by inward
    instinct, sometimes by dreams in the night, and sometimes by appearing
    outwardly. The <i>Dæmon</i> or <i>Genius</i> changeth its nature and power,
    as the person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
    changeth his: and if from good, the party degenerate
    to iniquity; then by degrees the good Angel leaves him, and an evil
    <i>Dæmon</i> doth naturally succeed: for each thing draws after that which
    is like it self.</p>

  <p>2. Magicians<span class="sni">Three ways of enjoying their society.</span>
     mention three several wayes of enjoying the society of
    the <i>Bonus Genius</i>; <span class="sni">The first way.</span>first
    by intellectual association, when secret and
    mental instigations do arise in their hearts, to do this or that, and
    to forbear the other: as in the Manuscript of <i>Nagar</i> the <i>Indian</i>,
    his own testimony of himself is to this effect: <i>My blessed Guardian</i>
    <span class="gothic">Damilkar</span>, <i>hath now so sweetly communicated himself unto me;
    That by all the manifestations, whereby a holy</i> Dæmon <i>can attend and
    converse with mankind, he appeareth unto me: first in the intellectual
    way, he is ever present, and every moment prompts me, what to act, what
    to forbear from acting: Ah had he not rushed up through the powers of
    my soul, and suddenly warned me in my Travel to</i> Quiansi <i>in</i> China,
    <i>through the airy Region, to turn nimbly to the right hand, at an
    instant, a mighty Troop of Devils, whose Leader was</i> <span class="gothic">Grachnoek</span>,
    <i>coming through that tract of air, had crusht me into a thousand
    peices</i>: This is the first degree of its appearing.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The second way.</span>3. Then he proceedeth in the language of <i>Sina</i>, describing the second
    way of its manifestation: <i>And when the deepest sleep hath overpoured
    me, I am never without him; sometimes my</i> <span class="gothic">Damilkar</span> <i>stands
    before me like a glorious Virgin, administring to me a Cup of the drink
    of the Gods, which my Intellectual man exhausteth: sometimes he brings
    cælestial Companies, and danceth round about me; and when after the
    weariness of the Senses, through contemplation I fell into gentle sleep
    on the holy Mountain of Convocation, which is called</i> Adan, <i>he shewed
    me the motion of the Heavens, the nature of all things, and the power
    of every evil</i> Dæmon.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The third way of their appearance.</span>4. Thirdly, he continueth to describe the External appearance of the
    <i>Genius</i>, to this effect: <span class="gothic">Damilkar</span> <i>appears before me at my
    desire; for my desires are as his desires: When I slept a long space in
    my private dwelling, he appeared outwardly, and watering me with the
    dew of the fourth Heaven, I awakned, when he had thrise said</i> <span class="gothic">Nankin
    Nagar</span>; <i>so the time being come, we mounted through the Air, unto
    the holy Mountain of Convocation.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their number.</span>5. In this Example the three degrees of the Apparition of the <i>Bonus
    Genius</i>, or <i>Good Dæmon</i> are excellently deciphered, which is also
    the same in the appearance of the <i>bad Genius:</i> and according to the
    deepest Magicians, there be <i>seven good Angels</i>, who do most frequently
    become particular Guardians, of all others, each to their respective
    capacities; and also <i>seven evil Dæmons</i>, that are most frequent in
    association with depraved persons, as Guardians to them./</p>

    of the <i>evil</i> ones is the very same to inform and instigate unto the

  <p><span class="snp"><b>44.</b></span>9. These are the names of the 7 <i>good</i> and <i>evil Dæmons</i>; according to
    the antient writing, on the Magical Art: who do also to many particular
    Cities and Countries, ascribe certain good and evil Angels; the one
    whereof protects and defends, the other inflicts Pestilence and Famin
    upon them: Like unto which is the story recorded by <i>Sigbertus</i><span class="sni">An example.</span> in
    <i>Chronicis</i>: <i>That in the 11<sup>th</sup> year of the reign of</i> Constans, <i>a
    good Angel and a bad were seen by the whole City of</i> Constantinople,
    <i>nightly to fly about the City; and as often as by the command of the
    good Angel, the other smote any house with a dart in his hand, such was
    the number that dyed in that house, according to the stroaks given.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sni">The uncertainty of communicating with Angels.</span>
    10. And indeed it is to be feared, that whosoever have ever pretended,
    or do at present alledge, that they enjoy familiarity with a familiar
    Spirit; I say its greatly to be suspected, that all such familiars
    belong to the Kingdom of Darkness; for such are too too officious,
    and ready to attend the depraved desires of mortal men;
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>whereas
    if communication with Angels, or good and holy Guardians be at all
    attainable, yet such is the difficulty of the attainment, that the
    examples thereof, if true, are exceeding rare: But in general, the
    writings of Magicians and Naturallists do plentifully abound with
    examples of this nature; whether good or evil, is yet to be determined.
    I have been told of a certain Country-man, in these dayes, who was
    continually pestered with the company of a woman, discerned by none
    but by himself: If he was upon Horse-back, she would be behind him: if
    at dinner, she sate at his elbow; if lying on his bed, there she was
    also present; And if at any time he had taken a journey, or gone about
    some unprofitable business, at such a time she accompanyed him not;
    and seldom escaped he some mischief when she was absent: But at last,
    for all her dutiful pretences, as she accompanyed him, riding through
    a deep and swift running River, she tumbled him into the deepest part,
    and lay upon him till she had strangled or drowned him.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Familiars in the time of the <i>Jews</i>.</span>
    11. Amongst the <i>Jews</i> this kind of Idolatry was frequent, to consult
    with and associate themselves unto familiar Spirits, whom they
    compelled to do them domestick service, dressing their Camels, lifting
    their burthens, and doing their messages: for the attaining their
    service they had many blasphemous Forms, and superstitious Ceremonies
    and Sacrifices; making the holy Names of God subservient to their
    accursed practices: one whose name was <span class="gothic">Baal=Ben=ammin</span>, was
    adjudged by the Law of <i>Moses</i> to be burnt for the like practices;
    being condemned in the time of one <i>Judah</i> a high Priest in the
    Captivity for killing an Infant, and with its blood performing
    Sacrifice to <span class="gothic">Baalzebub</span>, with various ceremonies intermixed; by
    which means his God had bequeathed unto him a certain Lacky from the
    Infernal Troop to attend and serve him for his whole life time: this
    is to be found in <i>Zoar</i>’s Coment upon <i>Berosus</i>, and <i>Belus</i>, who
    affirms, <i>That at his tryal he endeavoured to prove, that the same was
    the good Angel or Genius given unto him by the mercy of God</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Several men have wrote and methodized the Art of
    Conjuration.</span>12. Both the <i>Hebrew Cabalists</i> and <i>Heathen Magicians</i>, as also those
    addicted to Magick in Christianity, have all of them laid down certain
    forms of attaining the company of a good, or evil Angel, by number
    and astrological Observations, fitted to the rules of Conjuration and
    Invocations: And many of the superstitious <i>Rabbi</i>’s have affirmed,
    <i>That they were able by such practices, to cause the ghost of</i> Adam,
    Eve, <i>or any of the holy Patriarchs to appear unto them</i>: which was
    surely the delusion of Satan to harden their hearts. But in the
    Addition to the 15<sup>th</sup> Book of the <i>Discovery</i> this Subject is more
    practically handled; where many forms of obtaining the Society of the
    <i>Bonus</i>, or <i>Malus Genius</i>, are plainly decyphered: so far as with
    safety and convenience they could be described./</p>

  <p class="subhead"><i>Of the Astral Spirits of men departed: What they are: And why
    they appear again: And what Witchcraft may be wrought by them.</i></p>

  <p class="drop-after">
    <span class="drop-after"><span class="vat">1.</span><span class="drop-letter">A</span></span>S
    <span class="sni">The spirits of men return again.</span>
    the Astral Spirits separate, which belong not to any deceased
    person, do for many years survive, or continue; so if the party
    deceased hath departed in discontent, and melancholy, it is often known
    that they return again, and causing terrour to families and houses, do
    wait for opportunity to disburthen themselves, that at length they may
    come into their desired rest.</p>

  <p>2. The opinion<span class="sni">All men have starry Spirits.</span> of many is, <i>That the Devill in their likenesse is all
    that appears</i>: But the more Learned have sufficiently demonstrated,
    through Example, and Experience; <i>That the apparition is really proper
    to the person deceased</i>. Nor can it easily be denyd, That to every
    man, and woman, while they live the natural Life, there belongs a
    <i>Syderial</i>, or <i>starry Spirit</i>; which takes its original wholly from
    the Elemental property: And according to the weaker, or stronger
    capacity of the party, it hath the longer, or shorter continuance,
    after the bodyes decease.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">What sort of persons most frequently re-appear.</span>
    3. Such persons as are secretly murthered, and such as secretly murthur
    themselves, do most frequently appear again, and wander near the place
    where their Carcase is, till the radical moisture be totally consumed:
    according to the opinion of <i>Paracelsus</i>, after the consumption
    whereof, they can re-appear no longer, but are resolv’d into their
    first being, or <i>Astrum</i>, after a certain term of months, or years,
    according to the vigour, or force of that first attraction which was
    the only cause of their returning.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The manner and time of their appearance.</span>
    4. The manner and seasons of their appearing are various: Sometimes
    before the person, unto whom they do belong, depart this life, they do
    by external presentations forewarn him, near the time, that the day of
    death approacheth. As it is reported of <i>Codrus Laænus</i>, to whom an
    empty, meager Ghost appeared at midnight, signifying unto him, <i>how sad
      and lachrymable a Tragedy was shortly to attend him</i>; and also adding,
    <i>that he would visit him in the Execution thereof</i>: which proved not
    contrary to the words of the apparition; for at the very instant, when
    his Treacherous Wife had stab’d him at the heart, on a suddain he
    beheld the same, with preparations for his interment, whilst he yet
    survived, after the fatall wound was given.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span></p>

  <p><span class="sni">The reason thereof.</span>5. Sometimes the starry spirit of a person appears to his beloved
    Companion, many hundred of miles asunder, who was ignorant of the death
    of the party: And it hath often been heard, that when none of the
    kindred or family of the said party deceased, have ever been disturbed
    by it, or in the least been sensible of its appearing; yet to some of
    its most intimate acquaintance, it discovers it self, and importunes
    them to perform some ceremony, or other, that it may be returned into
    rest; or else discovers some treasure, which was hid by the party
    whilest alive, or else some murther which it had commited: But the most
    frequent cause of their returning, is when the party hath himself been
    privately murthered.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The power of Magitians over them.</span>6. For such is the poysonous malice, and bloudy spirit of the
    murtherers, that it sufficeth them not to have privately bereaved
    them of their Lives; but also by certain earnest Wishes, Curses, and
    Conjurations, they do afterwards adjure them, that for such a term
    of years, they shall never have power to appear again: Which wishes,
    being earnestly given forth, from the hellish root in the murtherer,
    do exceedingly torment the murthered parties spirit, taking deep
    impression thereon; so that it is alwayes in continual sorrow, and
    anguish, till the term of years be expired, and till the murther
    be made manifest to the world: after which discovery, it returns
    to perfect rest; This is well known to those that are exercised in
    Witchcraft, and cruell Murthers, though not common to those that
    murther but once./</p>

  <p><span class="snp"><b>46.</b></span>7. There be many Ancient families, in <i>Europe</i>, to whom the Ghost of
    their first Progenitor, or Ancestor appears immediately before the
    departure of some Heir, or chief in the same family: which assertion
    is confirmed by <i>Cardan</i>,<span class="sni">Example.</span> in an Example of “an Antient family, in the
    Dukedome of <i>Parma</i>, called the <i>Tortells</i>, to whom there belongs an
    ancient Castle, with a spatious Hall; near the Chimney of the said
    Hall an old decrepit Woman, for these hundreds of years, is wonted to
    appear, when any of the Family is about to dye: And it is reported
    amongst them that the same is the Ghost of one belonging to the same
    name, and family, who for her Riches, was murthered by some of her
    Nephews, and thrown into a pit.”</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The cause of the difficulty and paucity of appearances.</span>8. Many such apparitions do for many years continue to be seen in one
    particular place; ever watching for opportunity, to discover some
    murther, or Treasure hid: And the cause of the difficulty of the said
    discovery, consists in the nature of their substance; for could they
    make use of the organ of the Tongue, they might quickly discover it:
    or if they had the outward benefit of Hands, they might produce the
    said Treasure, or Carcase murthered, but this they are seldome able to
    accomplish; being destitute of the outward Organs,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span> and mediation of
    Hands to hold withall, or Tongue to vent their grievances: And that
    this is true, the manner of their appearance doth confirm it: For all
    that they are able to effect, if they have been murthered, is commonly
    to appear near the very place, where their body lies, and to seem as
    if they sunk down, or vanished in the same; or else to appear in the
    posture of a murthered person, with mangled, and bloudy wounds, and
    hair disshevel’d: But it is rarely known, that any such apparitions
    have plainly spoken, or uttered by words, the time of their murther,
    with the cause, the persons name, or place; unless the murther, by
    circumstances hath been more then ordinary, horrid, and execrable: then
    the remembrance of the same doth sometimes enable the apparition to
    frame a voice, by the assistance of the Air, and discover the fact.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">More particularly of the same.</span>9. But to speake in general concerning apparitions, why they are so
    seldome seen; and why such spirits as appear, can not without mans
    assistance accomplish their design; It may easily be apprehended, that
    all Spirits, or spiritual Substances, and Devills, have their life,
    breath, and motion in another source, or Element then this external
    world; And as any creature, whom the Element of Water hath nourished,
    and bred, can live but short while upon the Land; So its with them,
    when they come out of their proper habitations: which is the cause
    of the rarity of apparition; it being as difficult for any spirit to
    manifest it self in this outward principle, of the four Elements, as
    for a man to continue with his head under water: yea it is rather pain,
    then pleasure for any spirit, whether good, or bad, to come into this
    outward world.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The nefarious practices of <i>Necromancers</i> in an example.</span>10. Great is the villany of Necromancers, and wicked Magicians, in
    dealing with the spirits of men departed; whom they invocate, with
    certain forms, and conjurations, digging up their Carkasses again,
    or by the help of Sacrifices, and Oblations to the infernal Gods;
    compelling the Ghost to present it self before them: how this was
    performed in antient times, by Hags, and Witches, is notably described
    in the <i>Æthiopian</i> History of <i>Heliodorus</i>, in the practice “of an
    antient woman, who coming into the Camp, in the dead of night; where
    amongst many slaughtered bodies, the body of her Son was also slain;
    whose carkase she laid before her, digging a hole, and making a fire on
    each side, with the body in the midst; Then taking an earthen pot from
    a three footed stool, she poured honey out of it, into the pit; then
    out of another pot, she poured milk; and likewise out of the third:
    Lastly, she cast a Lump of hardned dough, in the form of a man into the
    pit: the Image was Crowned with Lawrell: then she threw in some of the
    Shrub called <i>Bdellium</i>: This done, with a sword she ran frantickly up
    and down,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
    cutting herself; and with a Lawrell branch sprinkled of her
    blood into the fire: at length whispering at her Sons ear, she caused
    him to arise, and questioning him of the fortune of his Brother, what
    was become of him, he answered dubiously speaking prospe/rity<span class="snp"><b>47.</b></span> to two
    persons that secretly beheld her, and telling her, That suddain death
    for her impiety attended her, which came to passe ere she left the
    place; after all these predictions, the Carcase ceased to answer any
    more: and tumbled groveling on the ground again.”</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Example.</span>11. And although by most men, as also by the Author in his foregoing
    Discovery, it is constantly believed, that the Witch of <i>Endor</i> raised
    not <i>Samuel</i>, nor the Ghost of <i>Samuel</i>, as not beleeving that there is
    an <i>Astral Spirit</i> or Ghost belonging unto every Man; yet it is very
    probable, that by her conjurations she caused his <i>Sydereal Spirit</i> to
    appear: which is possible to be effected: and hath been often done: as
    <i>Weaver</i> in his <i>Funeral Monuments</i> records of <i>Edward Kelly</i>, “who
    in the Park of <i>Walton Ledale</i> in the County <i>Lancaster</i>, with one
    <i>Paul Waring</i>, Invocated a Devil, and afterwards digg’d up the Corps
    of a poor man, that had been buried that very day, in a place near the
    same, called <i>Law Church-yard</i>: whom he compelled by Incantations, and
    Conjurations to speak, and utter prophetical words, concerning the
    master of one of his Assistants.”</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The state of the Starry Spirit.</span>12. According to the state and condition wherein a person dyes, so is
    it with their <i>Astral Spirit</i>: for if they died in perfect peace, and
    had come through the valley of true Repentance; being dead to this
    Life before it left them; then their <i>starry Spirit</i> doth enter into
    rest, in its proper source, or quality at the instant of their Decease:
    nor is it possible for all the Conjurations in Hell, to cause them to
    return, or appear again.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Why the Ghost of <i>Samuel</i> appeared.</span>13. But some might object, That <i>Samuel was an Holy Prophet, and
      attaind unto a perfect Life</i>; which is thus to be answered, that before
    Christ came into the world, none of the most Holy Prophets of God,
    did ever attain to that degree of blessednesse, that the Christians
    after Christ possessed: for in the time of the Law, a covering, or
    vail was spread over the faces of all people: and something there was
    that letted, or hindred their souls from any plain and perfect vision,
    and fruition of God; otherwise then through types, and shaddows, which
    partition wall, the end of Christs Incarnation was to break down.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The opinions of <i>Plato</i>.</span>14. In the writings of <i>Plato</i>, there be many strange Relations of the
    apparitions of Souls, of their torments, and purgations, of the cause
    of their returning, what their nature is, what their substance and
    property is, and what their food, and nourishment is: but he
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span> mistakes
    the <i>Soul</i> for the <i>Astral Spirit</i>: for the Soul in its returning
    and apparition is farr different; if a Holy Soul appear, it is to
    persons like it self, and that in sleep, warning them of dangers, and
    discovering heavenly secrets unto them: And if a Damned Soul appear,
    it is likewise to such as are of a nature like it self: whom it
    instigates, asleep, teaching them notorious Villanies in Dreams; and
    provoking them to every wicked cogitation.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Of <i>Pythagoras</i>.</span>15. The sect of <i>Pythagoras</i> have strange and antick opinions,
    concerning Souls, and Ghosts, or starry Spirits: whom they alledge
    to be frequently converted into <i>Gods</i>, or <i>Dæmons</i>, or <i>Demi-Gods</i>,
    and <i>Heroes</i>: (as the <i>Platonicks</i> do,) And that there is a continual
    traduction, and transmigration of Souls, from one to another, till
    they attain to be deify’d at last; and then that they do frequently
    appear, to those that be like themselves; instructing, and forewarning
    them: It was also the belief of many wise, and antient Philosophers,
    that the <i>Oracles</i> were from such <i>Dæmons</i>, as had been the Ghosts, or
    Souls of wise and excellent men: as <i>Apollo’s Oracle</i>, and the <i>Oracle</i>
    of <i>Pallas</i>, or <i>Minerva</i>: which opinions have much of reason and
    probability.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Of other Philosophers.</span>16. It is also the opinion of some, that the particular Spirits of
    famous men do after the death of the body, take up some particular
    habitations, near such places Cities, Towns, or Countries, as they most
    do affect, as Tutelaries, and Guardians unto them; Which is reported
    by <i>Vopiscus</i>, of <i>Apollonius Thyaneus</i>; That when his City <i>Thyana</i>
    was taken by <i>Aurelianus</i> the Emperour: and when he was in his Tent,
    pondering furiously how to destroy the same; the Ghost of <i>Apollonius</i>
    appeared unto him saying, Aurelianus, <i>if thou desirest to be a
    Conquerour, suppose not to slay these my Citizens</i>: Aurelianus, <i>if
    thou wilt be a Ruler, shed no innocent blood</i>: Aurelianus, <i>be meek,
    and gentle, if thou wouldst be a Conquerour</i>./</p>

  <p><span class="snp"><b>48.</b></span>17. I have heard many wonderful Relations from Lunaticks or such as are
    almost natural fools, who have asserted,<span class="sni">The Raptures of Lunaticks.</span> <i>That being for many daies
    together conversant amongst Faeries in Woods, Mountains, and Caverns
    of the Earth, they have feasted with them, and been magnificently
    Entertaind with variety of dainties, where they have seen several of
    their Neighbours or Familiar acquaintance in the habit they were wont
    to weare, notwithstanding they were known to have been dead some years
    before</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their Entertainments.</span>18. And many Learned Authors have also insisted upon this particular,
    alledging, <i>That when such as the Faeryes have brought into their
    Society do feast and junket with them, though they have a real and
    perfect knowledge of their neighbours and acquaintance amongst the
    rest, yet their Language they are not able to understand, neither
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
    do these Acquaintance of theirs acknowledge or take notice of them
    at all, but do either sit (both they and all the rest) in a profound
    and tedious silence, or else discourse in a most stupendious kinde of
    Gibberish, not intelligible to strangers</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">A strange example.</span>19. But more particularly to illustrate this conjecture, I could name
    the person who hath lately appeared thrice since his Decease, at
    least some Ghostly being or other, that calls it self by the name of
    such a person who was dead above an hundred years agoe, and in his
    life time accounted as a Prophet or Prædicter by the assistance of
    Sublunary Spirits. And now at his appearance did also give out strange
    Prædictions concerning Famine, and Plenty, Warrs, and Bloodshed, and
    the end of this world.</p>

  <p>20. By the affirmation of the person that had Communication with him,
    the last of his Appearances was on this following manner; <i>I had been</i>,
    said he, <i>to sell a Horse at the next Market Town, but not attaining
    my price, as I returned home by the way I met this man aforesaid who
    began to be familiar with me, asking what news, and how affairs moved
    throughout the Country</i>; I answered as I thought fit; withall I told
    him of my Horse whom he began to cheapen, and proceeded with me so far,
    that the price was agreed upon; so he turned back with me and told me,
    <i>that if I would go along with him, I should receive my Money</i>; on our
    way we went, I upon my Horse and he on another milk white beast; after
    much discourse I askt him where he dwelt, and what his name was; he
    told me, <i>That his dwelling was about a mile off, at a place called
    Farran</i>; of which place I had never heard though I knew all the Country
    round about; he also told me, <i>That he himself was that person of the
    Family of</i> Learmonts <i>so much spoken off for a Prophet</i>; At which I
    began to be somewhat fearful, perceiving us in a road which I had never
    been in before, which increased my fear and admiration more. Well on we
    went till he brought me under ground I know not how into the presence
    of a beautiful woman that payd me the moneys without a word speaking;
    he conducted me out again through a large and long entry, where I saw
    above 600 men in Armour layd prostrate on the ground as if asleep: at
    last I found my self in the open field by the help of Moon-light in
    that very place where first I met him, and made shift to get home by
    three in the morning, but the money I received was just double of what
    I esteemed it, and what the woman payd me, of which at this instant I
    have several pieces to show consisting of nine pences, thirteen pence
    halfpennies, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sni">Apparitions before Christianity, were frequent.</span>21.
    The variety of Examples throughout the writings of Learned men may
    serve as stronge inducements to confirm this particular of <i>Astral
    Spirits</i>, or <i>Ghosts</i> that belong unto Mortal men, returning
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span> after
    death untill the cause of their returning be taken away. In Ancient
    times before the name of Christianity, there was nothing more frequent
    than millions of Apparitions in fields where battails had been fought,
    seeming to fight as they had done at first, which the Ancient Heathens
    believed to proceed from the want of Burying. And from this arose the
    Poetical Romance of the <i>wandring of Ghosts besides the River Styx for
    an hundred years</i>. And the custome of Solemn Interment amongst them.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Why Funeral Piles were instituted.</span>22. But with more probability, The Custome of the Funeral Piles used
    by the <i>Romans</i>, and the Urns to reduce their Corpses into Ashes, was
    instituted at first to prevent the torment of the Deceased, least
    his Ghost should wander, or return, which doubtlesse from a natural
    cause may have the same effect, that the/<span class="snp" id="pa_49"><b>49.</b></span> reducing of the carcase into
    Ashes suddainly after its decease may prevent the return of the Astral
    Spirit; for if it be true what is affirmed by <i>Paracelsus</i>, that <i>the
    starry Spirit can continue no longer then the radical moisture in the
    body</i>; it will naturally follow that its appearance is at an end when
    the body is burnt, seeing that the moisture is totally exterminate and
    consumed thereby. And in some sense the Ceremony may be said to be
    Laudable and Judicious, having so beneficial a consequence.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">What the want of Burial causeth.</span>23. As there is some semblance of a natural cause in the custome of the
    Antient urns, so likewise may the Interment of slaughtered bodies by
    the like cause prevent the like Appearances; for many are the examples
    that I have read of such as appeared to their surviving kindred and
    acquaintance, after they had been slaughtered in the Warrs, beseeching
    them to perform unto their bodies the Sacred Funeral Rites that their
    Ghosts might return into Rest, for which many have consulted with the
    Oracles to be informed whether the deceased deserved Burial, because
    they held it unlawful to bury Murtherers, Incestuous and Sacriligious,
    persons, which Nature her self doth also seem to hold if this following
    Relation be not false: which was, “That some Learned men returning from
    <i>Persia</i> where they had been to see the King <i>Cosroes</i>, by the way
    interr’d a dead Carcase which they found unburied: And in the following
    night the Ghost of an Ancient Matron, as if it had been the Spirit of
    the World or Madam Nature her self, appeard unto them, saying, <i>Why
    Interr ye that nefarious Carcase? let the Doggs devoure it; The Earth
    who is the Mother of us all admitts not of that man that depraves his
    Mother</i>: So returning they found the Carcase yet unburied.</p>

  <p>24. To confirm the verity of <i>Astral Spirits</i> proper, and their
    returning, <span class="sni">The conclusion of this Chapter with an example.</span>I shall conclude this Chapter with the Example of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>
    famous <i>Aristeus</i> the Poet who “in the Isle <i>Marmora</i> dyed suddainly,
    at which instant a certain Philosopher of <i>Athens</i> arriving there,
    affirmed, <i>That he had lately been in Company and discourst with him</i>.
    In the mean time going to Bury him they found him yet alive, but never
    after that had he any constant residence amongst Mortals. Seven years
    after that he was seen at <i>Proconnesus</i> his native Town, and remaind a
    while composing several Poems and Verses called <i>Arimaspei</i>, and then
    vanished. In <i>Metapontis</i> he was seen 300 years after that, charging
    that <i>Apollo</i>’s Altar should be erected by the name of <i>Aristeus
    Proconnesius</i>. The like stories are reported of <i>Apollonius</i>, and
    <i>Pythagoras</i>, whom their followers would have to be <i>Ubiquitaryes</i>,
    affirming, <i>That at one instant of time they were seen in several
    places thousands of miles in distance</i>. And though in *<i>Iamblichus</i><span class="sni">[* sic]</span>
    who hath wrote the Life of <i>Pythagoras</i>, in <i>Philostratus</i> that wrote
    the Life of <i>Apollonius Tyanus</i>, there be many fabulous things reported
    as to the <i>Astral Spirits</i> separation, and return unto the body; Yet
    I have sufficiently here endeavoured to separate the true from the
    more Poetical part in this particular Subject of the <i>starry Spirits</i>
    belonging to every individual man and woman, and their returning after
    the body falls away.</p>

  <p>
    2. According<span class="snp"><b>50.</b></span><span class="sni">The Spirits of the Planets.</span>
    to the Judgment of Magicians, the Seven Planets have seven
    starry Spirits peculiar to themselves, whose natures are answerable
    to that peculiar Planet under which they are constitute. And they are
    said to be substitute under the seven Cælestial Angels that govern the
    influences of the superiour Spheres, being equal in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span> their name and
    continuance with that planet whose Spirit they are, that is, till the
    Consummation of all things visible.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The Power of the Planets.</span>3. And in that
    houre, month, day or year, wherein their Planet hath
    the most dominion, then is their efficacy most prevalent, and their
    operation the most powerful upon inferiour bodies, whether to the
    destruction or prosperity of that animal vegitative or mineral subject
    to their Influences, according to the dignification of the Planet at
    that instant Dominion; for if ill affected, their nature is to blast
    with Mildew, Lightning, and Thunder any Vegetative proper to their
    Planet; To deprive any Animal of sight or the motion of the nerves
    under their Dominion; And lastly, bring Plagues, Pestilence, and
    Famine, Storms, and Tempests, or on the Contrary to bring sweet and
    excellent Influences upon Animals, or Vegetatives under their Planetary
    Regiment, if well and honourably dignified.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Spirits of the Air.</span>4. Innumerable are the Spirits that inhabit the Aiery Region,
    germinating amongst themselvs as Magicians affirm, and begetting one
    another after a Mystical manner. It is their property to be instant in
    storms and boistrous weather, which is said to be joy and delight unto
    them; And in such a season they may with most facility be calld upon,
    and make their appearance, which they do accordingly to their age,
    and youthfulness, seeming young or old at their appearance answerable
    to their years. Besides they march in mighty Troops through the Aiery
    Region, waging warr amongst themselves, and destroying one anothers
    beings or Existences, after which they are reduced to the primary
    source or nature of the Starrs. This is likewise to be observed that
    according to the Language, Vigour, Life, and Habit of that Region
    wherein they live, such is their Habit, Language, and Ability, one
    <i>Caterva</i> or Company being ignorant of their Neighbours, or Enemies
    Language, so that they have need of the Assistance of such Spirits as
    dwell <i>in omnibus Elementis</i>, to be their Interpreters.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their Actions.</span>5. And doubtless from hence arise the various deceptions that*<span class="sni">[* thut <i>text</i>]</span>
    men are incident unto in their judgments of Apparitions, perswading
    themselves that they are portents and foretokens of Warr and Famine,
    when such numerous Spirits are beheld Fighting or Marching either in
    the Air, Earth, or Water: whereas it is nothing else but the bare
    effect of the Natures and Tempers of such Aerial beings to fight and
    randevouse immediately after sun-set, or else later in the Summer
    evenings, which is their principal time of such Conventions. And
    though it must be confest that such Spirits may be, and are the Devils
    Instruments as appertaining to the Kingdom whereof he is Ruler; Yet
    considered in themselves, their Nature is wholly harmless, as to ought
    that may be called <i>innate Evill</i>, having nothing in them
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>that is
    eternal as the Soul of Man: and consequently nothing in them that is
    able to make them capable of enjoying Heaven, or induring the torments
    of Hell.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Spirits appropriate to the Spheres.</span>6. And it is believed by some, that according to the motion of the
    spheres, there are certain companies of Aerial Spirits good and
    bad that follow them in their motions round the earth, the good
    distilling influences that are good, and the bad, such influences as
    are destructive to every thing that is under their Dominion. It is
    also believed that by the assistance of Devils, and damned Spirits,
    such Aerial Spirits are given for Familiars to some Magicians
    add*<span class="sni">[* <i>read</i>, and]</span> Witches with whom they are said to have actual copulation,
    and the enjoyment of every dainty meat through their assistance,
    being able thereby to go invisible, to fly through the air, and steal
    Treasures and Jewels from the Coffers of Princes, as also carouse in
    Wine-sellers, and Pantries of those that are most amply provided with
    the choisest Daynties.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Terrestial Spirits.</span>7. Subordinate unto these of the Air are the Terrestrial Spirits, which
    are of several degrees according to the places which they occupy,
    as Woods, Moun/tains,<span class="snp"><b>51.</b></span> Caves, Fens, Mines, Ruins, Desolate places,
    and Antient Buildings, calld by the Antient Heathens after various
    names, as <i>Nymphs</i>, <i>Satyrs</i>, <i>Lamii</i>,*<span class="sni">[* read, <i>Lamiæ</i>]</span> <i>Dryades</i>, <i>Sylvanes</i>, <i>Cobali</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
    And more particularly the <i>Faeries</i>, who do principally inhabit the
    Mountains, and Caverns of the Earth, whose nature is to make strange
    Apparitions on the Earth in Meddows, or on Mountains being like Men,
    and Women, Souldiers, Kings, and Ladyes Children, and Horse-men
    cloathed in green, to which purpose they do in the night steal hempen
    stalks from the fields where they grow, to Convert them into Horses as
    the Story goes. Besides, it is credibly affirmed and beleev’d by many,
    That such as are real Changlings, or Lunaticks, have been brought by
    such Spirits and Hobgoblins, the true Child being taken away by them in
    the place whereof such are left, being commonly half out of their wits,
    and given to many Antick practices, and extravagant fancies, which
    passions do indeed proceed from the powerful influence of the Planet in
    their nativity, and not from such foolish conjectures.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Faeries.</span>8. Such jocund and facetious Spirits are sayd to sport themselvs in the
    night by tumbling and fooling with Servants and Shepherds in Country
    houses, pinching them black and blew, and leaving Bread, Butter, and
    Cheese sometimes with them, which if they refuse to eat, some mischief
    shall undoubtedly befall them by the means of these Faeries. And many
    such have been taken away by the sayd Spirits, for a fortnight, or a
    month together, being carryed with them in Chariots through the Air,
    over Hills, and Dales, Rocks and Precipices, till at last they have
    been found lying in some Meddow or Mountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>
    bereaved of their sences, and commonly of one of their Members to boot.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Lares, and Domestick Spirits.</span>9. Certainly the <i>Lares</i> and <i>Penates</i>, or houshold Gods of the antient
    Heathens were no other than such like Spirits who for several years
    would keep their residence in one house till upon some displeasure
    offered, or offences done by any of the sayd Family, they departed and
    were never afterwards heard of. There are plenty of such examples to
    be found in <i>Olaus Magnus</i>, and <i>Hector Boethus</i>*<span class="sni">[* <i>read</i>, Boethius]</span> in his History
    of <i>Scotland</i>, relating wonderful passages of <i>Robin-goodfellows</i>, and
    such as have been familiar amongst mankind.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Luridan</i> a famaliar Spirit.</span>10. <span class="gothic">Luridan</span> a familiar of this kinde did for many years inhabit
    the Island <i>Pomonia</i>, the largest of the <i>Orcades</i> in <i>Scotland</i>,
    suplying the place of Man-servant and Maid-servant with wonderful
    diligence to these Families whom he did haunt, sweeping their rooms,
    and washing their dishes and making their fires before any were up in
    the morning. This <span class="gothic">Luridan</span> affirmed, That he was the <i>genius
    Astral</i>, of that Island that his place or residence in the dayes of
    <i>Solomon</i> and <i>David</i>was at <i>Jerusalem</i>; That then he was called by the
    <i>Jewes</i> <span class="gothic">Belelah</span>, and after that he remaind Long in the Dominion
    of <i>Wales</i>, instructing their Bards in <i>Brittish</i> Poesy and Prophesies
    being called <span class="gothic">Urthin, Wadd, Elgin</span>: And now said he, I have
    removed hither, and alas my continuance is but short, for in 70 years I
    must resigne my place to <span class="gothic">Balkin</span> Lord of the <i>Northern</i> mountains.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Balkin</i> a Familiar.</span>11. Many wonderful and incredible things did he also relate of this
    <span class="gothic">Balkin</span>, whom he called the Lord of the <i>Northern</i> Mountains,
    affirming that he was shaped like a Satyr and fed upon the Air, having
    Wife and Children to the number of 12 thousand which were the brood of
    the <i>Northern</i> Faeries inhabiting <i>Southerland</i> and <i>Catenes</i> with the
    adjacent Islands; And that these were the Companies of Spirits that
    hold continual wars with the Fiery Spirits in the Mountain <i>Heckla</i>
    that vomits fire in <i>Islandia</i>. That their speech was antient Irish,
    and their dwelling the Caverns of the Rocks, and Mountains, which
    relation is recorded in the Antiquities of <i>Pomonia</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">A strange example.</span>12. I have read another wonderful relation in a book <i>de Annulis
    Antiquorum</i>, Concerning a young man from whom the power of <i>Venus</i> was
    taken away so that he could not Company with his new marryed Wife.
    The Story is briefly thus; “Being busy at play or exercise with some
    of his Companions on his marriage day, he put his wedding Ring on the
    finger of the Statue of <i>Venus</i> that stood besides the place least
    it should be lost; when he had done, returning to take his Ring, the
    finger was bended inward, so that he could by no means pluck off/<span class="snp"><b>52.</b></span> the
    Ring to his great amazement, at which instant he forsooke the place,
    and in the night the Image of <i>Venus</i>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>appeared unto him, saying, Thou
    hast espoused me, and shalt not meddle with any other: in the morning
    returning, the Ring was gone, and the finger made straight again, which
    troubled him mightily, so that he consulted with a Magician, who wrote
    a Letter to some Principal Spirit in that Dominion to which <i>Venus</i>
    belong’d, bidding the party stand watching at such a place at such an
    houre till he saw many troops of Spirits pass by him, and describing
    one in a Chariot, of stern and terrible Countenance, to whom he bad
    him deliver the Letter; All which he performed, and after the person
    in the Chariot had read the contents thereof, he broke out into this
    expression, great God, how long shall we be subject to the insolencies
    of this accursed Rascal, naming the Magitian: But withal calling to
    a most beauteous Woman from amongst the Company, he charged her to
    deliver back the Ring which at length she did with much aversness, and
    after that he injoyd his Marriage rites without impediment.”</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Spirits of Woods, and Mountains.</span>
    13. Besides the innumerable Troops of Terrestrial Spirits called
    <i>Faeryes</i> there are also <i>Nymphs</i> of the Woods, Mountains, Groves,
    and Fountains, as <span class="gothic">Eagle</span>,*<span class="sni">[* read, <i>Aegle</i>]</span> <span class="gothic">Arethusa</span>, <span class="gothic">Io</span>,
    <span class="gothic">Menippa</span>, <span class="gothic">Irene</span>, &amp;c. who are sayd to be altogether of the
    fæminine kinde, sporting and dancing, and feasting amongst the trees in
    Woods, and bathing in clean and limpid Fountains; such have been seen
    by many, and are often alluded to, by the <i>Roman</i> and <i>Greek</i> Poets.
    There is also a relation of a <i>German</i> Prince, “who being exceeding
    thirsty and weary with hunting and hawking, lost his Company in the
    Woods, on a suddain beheld an opening at a little hillock amongst the
    trees, and a most beautiful Maiden offering a Golden Horn full of
    Liquor, which he received and drunk, and after rid quite away with the
    sayd Horn, not regarding the Virgins tears, who lamented after him; tis
    sayd that having spilt some of the sayd Liquor, it fetcht the hair from
    off his Horses skin, and the horn is yet to be seen in <i>Germany</i>, which
    I have been told by one that hath seen and handled it, affirming, <i>That
    the Gold for purity cannot be parallel’d</i>.”</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Incubi</i>, and <i>Succubi</i>.</span>14. Another sort are the <span class="gothic">Incubi</span>, and <span class="gothic">Succubi</span>, of whom it
    is reported, that the Hunns have the original, being begotten betwixt
    these <span class="gothic">Incubi</span>, and certain Magical women whom <i>Philimer</i> the King
    of the <i>Goths</i> banished into the deserts, whence arose that savage
    and untamed Nation, whose speech seemed rather the mute attempts of
    brute Beasts, than any articulate sound and well distinguished words.
    To these <i>Incubi</i> are attributed the diseases of the blood called
    the <i>Nighthag</i>, which certainly have a natural cause, although at
    the instant of time when the party is oppressed, it is probable that
    certain malevolent Spirits may mix themselvs therein and terrifie the
    soul and minde of the afflicted party.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span></p>

  <p><span class="sni">A froward kinde of Spirit.</span>15. And amongst such Spirits as are resident amongst mortals, there
    is a very froward kinde, who take delight to pull down what man hath
    builded, who have been seen at the building of strong and mighty
    Castles to come in the night and tumble all to the ground that the
    workmen had reared the day before; of this sort were <span class="gothic">Horon</span>,
    <span class="gothic">Stilkon</span>, <span class="gothic">Glaura</span>, and <span class="gothic">Kibbolla</span>, four pestiferous,
    and turbulent Animals that for many years infested the first founders
    of the Emperours <i>Seraglio</i>: Till one of the holy Musselmans did by
    certain Charms, and Exorcisms constrain and bind them, to tell their
    names, and the cause of their disturbing, which they declared, and were
    by him confined to destroy the mines of Copper in <i>Hungaria</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Example.</span>16. There is also a Relation extant in the life of <i>Paul</i> the Hermit of
    a Satyr appearing to him in the Woods, and discoursing with him that
    it was a mortal Creature as he, and served the same God, dehorting the
    people to worship them for demi-Gods, as they had been accustomed to;
    Like unto this is the Story of the Death of the great God <i>Pan</i>; That a
    Mariner sailing by the Island of <i>Cicilia</i>, was called by his name from
    the shore,<span class="sni">Example.</span> and by a certain voice was bid to tell the Inhabitants of
    the next Island, that the great God <i>Pan</i> was dead, which he o/beyed,<span class="snp"><b>53.</b></span>
    and though in the next Island there were no Inhabitants, yet when he
    approached he proclaimed, towards the shoar that <i>Pan</i> was deceased,
    immediately after which Proclamation he could sensibly hear most
    doleful and lachrymable Cryes, and noyses, as of those that lamented
    his departure.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Janthe</i> a Spirit of the water.</span>17. <span class="gothic">Ianthe</span>, is sayd by Magitians, to be a water Spirit, who
    is ever present when any are drownd in the water, being delighted
    much in the destruction of mankinde, that it may enjoy the Company of
    their Astral Spirits after their decease; for according to the four
    Complexions or Constitutions of the body of Man, The Astral Spirit
    associates it self with separated substances; The Phlegmatick, to the
    watry Spirits: The Sanguine, to those of the Aire; The Cholerick, to
    the Fire; and the Melancholy, to the Terrestrial Spirits. But this
    is only to be supposed of such persons as dyed in discontent, and
    restlesness.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Watry Spirits that procreate.</span>18. Of another sort are such <i>Aquatick Animals</i> as in former times
    have conversed, and procreated with mankinde bearing divers Children;
    And at length snatching all away into the watry Element again, whereof
    there are variety of Examples in <i>Cardanus</i> and <i>Bodin</i>. Of this
    sort was the Familiar of <i>Paulus</i> a Mendicant Frier, called by him
    <span class="gothic">Florimella</span>, and entertaind as his Bed-fellow for forty years,
    though unknown and unseen to any but himself, till upon some unhandsome
    carriage of the Fryer, his Companion accompanying him over the
    <i>Danube</i>, leapt into the River and was never after seen.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span></p>

  <p><span class="sni">Apparitions on the water.</span>19. Innumerable
    are the reports and accidents incident unto such as
    frequent the seas, as fisher-men and sailers who discourse of noises,
    flashes, shadows, ecchoes, and other visible appearances nightly seen,
    and heard, upon the surface of the water. And as the disposition of the
    Heavens is according to the constellations, and climates, so are these
    spectres appropriate to particular parts, and coasts, from the North to
    the Southern Pole. But more especially, abounding in the North, about
    <i>Norweigh Isleland</i>, <i>Green Land</i>, and <i>Nova Zembla</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Prophetical rivers, and vocal fountains.</span>20. Neither are the Storyes of the Greek, and Latine Poets all together
    to be sleighted in this particular; for many verities are interwoven
    with their fictions, they speak of vocal Forrests, as <i>Dodona</i>,
    of <i>Talkative</i> Rivers, as <i>Scamander</i>, of sensitive Fountains as
    <i>Arethusa</i>, <i>Menippa</i>, and <i>Æagle</i>; Which more credible Historians
    have partly confirmed in the Relation of <i>Dodona</i>, asserting that
    the trees do seem to speak by reason of the various Apparitions, and
    Phantasms, that attend the Forrest. And also in the Story of the
    River <i>Scamander</i>, which is sayd at this day to afford plenty of
    spectres, and prophetical Spirits, that have nightly conversation
    with the <i>Turkish</i> Sailers coming by that way with Gallyes into the
    <i>Mediterranean</i>.</p>

  <p>21. The like is reported of a Castle in <i>Norweigh</i> standing over a Lake
    wherein a Satyr appeareth sounding a Trumpet before the death of any
    Souldier, or Governour belonging to the same, tis sayd to be the <span class="sni">Example.</span>Ghost
    of some murdered Captain that hath become so Fatal, and Ominous to his
    Successors. But with more probability may be called a Spectre proper to
    the place according to the Constellation.</p>

  <p>22. And it hath been the conjecture of eminent speculators that from
    the Loins of such arise the numerous brood<span class="sni">Spirits in <i>Green-Land</i></span>
    of <i>Elves</i>, <i>Faeryes</i>,
    <i>Lycanthropi</i>; And <i>Pigmyes</i>, sometimes visible, sometimes invisible in
    <i>Green-Land</i> and the adjacent rocks where they have no concomitants,
    but bears and scurvy-grass to mix, and make merry withal, except they
    pass from thence to the <i>Northern</i> parts of <i>America</i>, where they shall
    find their off-spring adored for Gods, and Goddesses, by the ignorant
    Inhabitants about new <i>Albion</i>, and as far <i>South</i> as <i>Mexico</i>, as is
    amply related in the discourses of <i>Drake</i>, <i>Cortes</i> and <i>Purchas</i>
    concerning the conquest and discovery of these Territoryes.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Destroying Spirits.</span>23. By Apparitions upon the water many have been tempted to leap into
    the Sea in pursuit thereof till they were drowned, of which spectres
    there is a sort called by <i>Psellus</i>, <i>Ordales</i>, who do appear like
    Ducks or other Water fouls, till they by fluttering upon the water, do
    entice their followers to pursue them so farr that many perish in the
    attempt, which doth greatly delight these faithless/<span class="snp"><b>54.</b></span> Spirits who (as
    we have said before) do long to accompany their Astral Spirits after
    their decease. An Example of this kinde I my self knew, besides the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>
    numerous relations I have had from the mouths of others, which confirm
    the opinions of the antient Magicians concerning these water Spirits,
    that of all the rest they are the most deceitful, and dangerous, like
    the flattering Seas, and swift gliding Torrents, that when they have
    wonn any thing, to admire, and sound them, do carry them violently into
    the abysse of their own Element.</p>

  <p>24. But we will leave the waters and insist a little on the nature of
    <i>Igneous</i> or <i>Fiery Spirits</i><span class="sni">Fiery Spirits.</span> that inhabit the Mountains in <i>Hecla</i>,
    <i>Ætna</i>, <i>Propo Champ</i>, and <i>Poconzi</i>; Where the Courts, and Castles of
    these puissant Champions are kept. The opinion of some is, <span class="sni">What
    these Spirits are.</span><i>That they
    are not Astral, but Infernal Spirits, and Damned Souls, that for a term
    of years are confined to these burning Mountains for their Iniquities</i>:
    Which opinion although it be granted, yet we may assert, That for the
    most part the apparitions, sounds, noices, clangors, and clamors, that
    are heard about the Mountain <i>Hecla</i> in <i>Island</i> and other places,
    are the effects of separated Starry beings, who are neither capable
    of good nor evill, but are of a middle vegetative nature, and at the
    dissolution of the <i>Media Natura</i> shall be again reduced into their
    primary Æther.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Why they delight in the fiery element.</span>25.
    And from natural Causes, it may be easily demonstrated, That there
    is great Correspondence betwixt such substances, and the Element of
    fire, by reason of the Internal Flagrat and Central Life proceeding
    from the Quintessence or*<span class="sni">[* ? of]</span> one only Element which upholds them,
    in Motion, Life, and Nourishment. As every natural, and supernatural
    being is upheld, and maintain’d out of the self-same root from whence
    it had its original, or rise; So the Angels feed upon the <i>Celestial
    Manna</i>, The Devils of the fruits of Hell, which is natural to their
    appetite, as trash for swine; the Astral beings; of the source of the
    stars, the Beasts, Birds, or Reptiles of the fruits of the Eatth,†<span class="sni">[† <i>sic</i>]</span>
    and the gas of the Air, the fishes of the blass of the Water; But more
    particularly, every thing is nourished by its Mother, as Infants at the
    Breast, either by exhausting or fomentation.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Spirits that burn Cities.</span>26. Such Spirits are very officious in the burnings of Towns, or
    Cole-pits, delighting much to dance and exult amidst the flames, and
    become Incendiaries worse then the material Cause of the Combustion,
    often tempting men in drukeness,‡<span class="sni">[‡ <i>sic</i>]</span> to burn their own Houses, and
    causing Servants carelesly to sleep, that such unlucky accidents may
    happen. As the Story of <i>Kzarwilwui</i> a Town in <i>Poland</i> doth confirm,
    which was reduced to ashes by three of these pestilentious Animals,
    called <span class="gothic">Saggos</span>, <span class="gothic">Broundal</span>, and <span class="gothic">Baldwin</span>, who after
    many open Threatnings for six months together, that they would destroy
    the City, and Citizens, did on a dark and stormy night, set all on fire
    on a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
    suddain in twenty or thirty several places, which irrecoverably
    destroyed the Inhabitants.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their food and pastime.</span>27. As for the nourishment of fiery Spirits, it is radical heat, and
    the influence of the Aery Region; their sport and pastime consisteth
    for the most part in tumbling, and fooling one with another when the
    flames are most impetuous, and violent in the Mountains: And it is
    likewise credited by some that their office is to cruciate and punish
    some Evil Livers, retaining, and tormenting their Souls, or Astral
    Spirits for many years after the Bodies decease, which is too empty
    a notion to be hearkened unto by any that are well informed of their
    natures.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Why they delight in the fiery quality.</span>28. Neither is it to be wondered at that they are so much delighted
    with the fiery quality in regard of their affinity and appropriation
    with infernal spirits, whose state and being is altogether damnable and
    deplorable; for although they have not the ability of attaining either
    the Heavenly or Infernal quality, by reason that they are utterly voyd
    of the innermost Center, and may be rather called bruits, then rational
    Animals, yet because they belong to the outermost *principle,<span class="sni">* Fire]</span> such
    is their innate Affinity, and Unity with the dark World, or infernal
    Kingdome that they do often become the Devils Agents to propagate his
    works upon the face of the Earth./</p>

  <p><span class="snp"><b>55.</b></span><span class="sni">Astral Spirits ministers to the devill.</span>
    29. By the Instigations of infernal Spirits they are often sent to
    terrifie men with nocturnal visions, in the likeness of monstrous
    Beasts or Ghosts of their deceased Friends. They are moreover often
    abetted to tempt and provoke melancholy people to execute themselves;
    besides innumerable wayes they have of executing the pleasures of
    *iniquous<span class="sni">[* <i>sic</i>]</span> Spirits through malicious Instigations, and secret
    Stratagems projected by them to the destruction of mortal men,
    especially when the work to be effected by the Devil is too too hard
    for his subtle and spiritual nature to bring to pass, because the
    same belongs to the Astral source or outward principle to which these
    dubious Spirits do properly belong; then are they frequently sollicited
    to mediate in such treacherous actions, as the hellish Spirits have
    conspired against the Lives of mortal men.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Why the devil requires their help.</span>30. More particularly, These Spirits that belong to the fiery Element,
    are most officious in this kinde of service, being naturally such as
    the Antecedent matter hath sufficiently demonstrated; but according to
    the ranks and Categoryes to which they belong, some of them are more
    inveterate, and malicious in their undertakings then the rest. But
    every kinde of Astral Spirit is obsequious to the Kingdome of darkness,
    that the devilish Spirits can effect little or nothing without their
    assistance in this external principle of the Starrs and Elements upon
    the bodies or possessions of Mankind; because their bodies are
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>too
    crude and rough for the conveyance of their influence, either in
    Dreams, Raptures, Philtres, Charms, or Constellations, as the following
    Chapter of the nature of Infernal beings shall make plain, wherein the
    nature and capacity of every damned Spirit is decyphered according to
    the truth of the antient Philosophy.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Subterranean Spirits.</span>31. Leave we now the Spirits of the fire, to illustrate the natures of
    subterranean Beings, whose Orders, Species, and Degrees, are various;
    for they consist in these distinctions, <i>viz.</i> Spirits of men deceased,
    Souls of men deceased, separated Spirits Astral, separate Spirits
    semi-Infernal, Spirits appropriate to the Constellations where any of
    the seven metals, <i>viz. Saturn</i>, <i>Jupiter</i>, <i>Mars</i>, <i>Sol</i>, <i>Luna</i>, <i>Venus</i>,
    <i>Mercury</i>, are found in the bowels of the Earth; and as farr as the
    natures of Minerals are distinct one from the other, so much distant
    are these Subterranean Spirits in Nature and Faculty in respect of
    their places, shapes, names, and qualities.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Spirits of the Mountains, Caves, and Tombs.</span>
    32. But they are not all confined unto the metallick Kingdome; for
    there are also Spirits of the Mountains, Vallies, Caves, Deeps,
    Hiata’s, or Chasma’s of the Earth, hidden Treasures, Tombs, Vaults,
    and Sepultures of the Dead. To the last belong the Astral Spirits of
    deceased Mortals, that delight to hover over the antient Carcases to
    which they belong’d, seeking still to be dissolved, and diligently
    enquiring the Cause of their retention; such are resident in silent
    Caves, and solitary Vaults, where the deceased lie till the Humidum
    Radicale be exciccate, and totally dryd up, after which their tricks
    are no more manifest, but are utterly extinguished, and annihilated.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Spirits of hidden Treasures.</span>
    33. To the next, belong such Spirits as are Protectors of hidden
    Treasures, from a natural Cause, from whence they do exceedingly envy
    mans benefit, and accomodation in the discovery thereof, ever haunting
    such places where money is conceal’d, and retaining malevolent and
    poysonous Influences, to blast the Lives and Limbs of those that dare
    to attempt the discovery thereof: <i>Peters</i> of <i>Devonshire</i> with his
    confederates, who by Conjuration attempted to dig for such defended
    Treasures, was crumbled into Atomes, as it were, being reduced to Ashes
    with his Companions in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The nature of such Spirits.</span>
    34. And upon this particular, we have plenty of Examples of the
    destruction of such as by Magical experiments have discovered hidden
    Treasures; which instances do rather seem to prove, That such as haunt
    these places do more nearly belong to the Infernal, then to the Astral
    Hierarchy, in regard that they are so infesting and inveterate to
    Mortal men, that the Grand Intention of the Prince of darkness may be
    accomplished in their designs./</p>

  <p><span class="snp" id="pa_56"><b>56.</b></span><span class="sni">Spirits that infest Mines and Miners.</span>
    35. But of all the rest such as haunt Mines and mettle men, are the
    most pernicious, and frequent from the same Cause with the former.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
    The nature of such is very violent; they do often slay whole Companies
    of Labourers, they do sometimes send inundations that destroy both
    the Mines, and Miners, they bring noxious and malignant vapours to
    stifle the laborious workmen; briefly, their whole delight and faculty
    consists in tormenting, killing, and crushing men that seek such
    Treasures, that mankind may never partake thereof to relieve their
    Cares, and worldly necessities.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">An Example of a turbulent Spirit.</span>36. Such was <i>Anæbergius</i> a most virulent Animal that did utterly
    confound the undertakings of those that laboured in the richest Silver
    mine in <i>Germany</i>, called <i>Corona Rosacea</i>. He would often shew himself
    in the likeness of a he-goat with Golden horns, pushing down the
    workmen with great violence, sometimes like a Horse breathing flames,
    and pestilence at his Nostrils. At other times he represented a Monk in
    all his <i>Pontificalibus</i>, flouting at their Labour, and imitating their
    Actions with scorn and dedignation, till by his daily and continued
    molestation he gave them no further ability of perseverance.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Conclusion.</span>37. Thus, I have hinted the various distinctions, and sub-distinctions
    of Astral Spirits proper or common, illustrating their natures
    according to the opinions of the Learned; from thence I proceed to say
    what the Infernal Hierarchy is, and whereof it doth consist in this
    fifth Chapter following.</p>

    <span class="sni">What this Chapter treats of.</span>
    the Astral Kingdome, I will now proceed to describe the
    natures, and distinctions of Infernal Spirits or Devils, and damned
    Souls, who are to be considered according to their ranks, and orders,
    exactly correspondent to the Quires, and Hierarchies of the Angels,
    or Celestial beings, wherein I will insist upon their names, shapes,
    places, times, orders, powers, and capacities, proceeding gradually
    from a general narration, to a particular Anatomy of every sort of
    Spirit in its proper place and order.</p>

  <p>2. As for<span class="sni">The place of hell or the habitation of devils.</span> the Locality or Circumscription of the Kingdome of darkness,
    it is farr otherwise to be considered then the vulgar account it,
    who esteem the hellish habitation, a distinct Chasma or Gulph in a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>
    certain place, above, under, or in the Center of the Earth, where
    innumerable Devils, and wicked Souls inhabit, who are perpetually
    scorched, and tormented with material flames of fire. This is the
    opinion which naturally all men are addicted and prone unto. But if we
    will rightly consider the Kingdome of Heaven and Hell, in respect of
    one another, we must look upon the similitude of light and darkness
    in this outward world, who are not circumscribed, nor separate as to
    Locality from one another; for when the sun arises, the darkness of the
    night disappeareth, not that it removes it self to some other place or
    Country, but the brightness of the light overpowereth it, and swallows
    it up, so that though it disappeareth, yet it is as really there as the
    light is.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Illustrated by a similitude.</span>3. This is also to be considered in*
    <span class="sni">[* <i>text</i> iu]</span>the description of the
    Habitations of good, or evill beings, that they are really in one
    another, yet not comprehended of one another, neither indeed can they
    be, for the evil Spirits if they should remove ten thousand miles,
    yet are they in the same quality and source, never able to finde out
    or discover where the Kingdome of Heaven is to be found, though it be
    really through, and through with the dark Kingdome, but in another
    quality which makes them strangers to one another.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The differerence [<i>sic</i>] betwixt heaven and hell.</span>4. A similitude hereof we have in the faculties of the humane Life,
    as to the indowments of the Soul considered in the just, and in the
    wicked; for to be good, pure, and holy, is really present as a quality
    in <i>potentia</i> with the depraved/<span class="snp"><b>57.</b></span> soul, although at that instant the
    Soul be cloathed with Abominations, so that the eye which should behold
    God or Goodness is put out. Yet if the soul would but come out of it
    self, and enter into another source or principle, in the center it
    might come to see the Kingdome of Heaven within it self, according to
    the Scripture, and <i>Moses</i>,*<span class="sni">[* Deut. 30, 19.]</span> <i>The word is nigh thee, in thy heart,
    and in thy Mouth</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">How the Devils can come into this World.</span>5. True it is that the Devils and damned Souls cannot sometimes
    manifest themselvs in this Astral World, because the nature of some of
    them is more near unto the external quality then of others, so that
    although properly the very innermost and outermost darkness be their
    proximate abode, yet they do frequently flourish, live, move, and
    germinate in the Aery Region, being some of them finite and determinate
    Creatures.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The great difficulty of their appearance.</span>6. But according to their fiery nature, it is very difficult for them
    to appear in this outward world, because there is a whole principle
    or gulph betwixt them, to wit, they are shut up in another quality
    or existence, so that they can with greater difficulty finde out the
    being of this World, or come with their presence into the same, then we
    can remove into the Kingdome of Heaven, or Hell with our intellectual
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span>
    man; for if it were otherwise, and that the Divels had power to appear
    unto Mortals as they list, how many Towns, Cities, <i>&amp;c.</i> should be
    destroyed, and burnt to the ground, how many Infants should be kild
    by their malicious power! yea few or none might then escape in Lives,
    or Possessions, and sound minds, whereas now all these enjoyments are
    free amongst mortals, which proves, that it is exceeding hard for evill
    Spirits to appear in the third principle of this world, as for a man to
    live under water, and fishes on the Land. Yet must we grant, that when
    the imaginations, and earnest desires of some particular Wizards, and
    envious Creatures have stirr’d up the center of Hell within themselvs,
    that then the Devil hath sometimes access to this world in their
    desires, and continues here to vex, and torment so long as the strength
    of that desire remains which was the first attractive Cause.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The cause of few appearances now.</span>
    7. For the very cause of the paucity of appearances in these dayes, is
    the fulness of time, and the brightness of Christianity, dispelling
    such mists, as the sun doth cause the clouds to vanish, not by any
    violence or compulsion, but from a natural cause; even so the Kingdome
    of Light as it grows over mans soul, in power and dominion, doth
    naturally close up the Center of darkness, and scatter the influences
    of the Devil so that his tricks lye in the dust, and his will at length
    becomes wholly passive as to man.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The Devils power in the time of the Law.</span>8. In the time of the Law, when the wrath and jealousie of the Father,
    had the dominion in the Kingdom of Nature, all Infernal Spirits had
    more easie access unto mankind then now they have; for before the
    Incarnation of Christ, the anger of God had more dominion over the
    soul of Man, and was more near in nature unto the same; so that the
    Devils could with more facility spring up in the element of Wrath, to
    manifest themselves in this outward principle, because the very Basis
    and Foundation of Hell beneath, is built and composed of the Wrath of
    God, which is the channel to convey the Devil into this sublunary World.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">His power under Christ in the flesh.</span>
    9. But when Christ began to be manifest unto the World, the
    multiplicity of Appearances, and possessed with Devils, began
    insensibly to decay and vanish. And if any should object, <i>That betwixt
    the space of his Incarnation and his Suffering, such accidents were
    rather more frequent than in the times before</i>: To this I answer, That
    the Devil knowing well that his time was but short; and also knowing,
    that till the great Sacrifice was offered up, he had leave to range and
    rove abroad the Kingdom of this World; therefore he imployed all his
    forces and endeavours to torment those miserable souls and captives to
    whom Christ came to Preach Deliverance.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Under Christianity.</span>10. But after the Partition wall was broken down, and the vail of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
    <i>Moses</i>, and of the anger of God from off the soul in the death of
    Christ, there was a sensible and visible decay of the Devils prancks
    amongst mortals, and that little remnant/<span class="snp"><b>58.</b></span> of Lunaticks and Possessed,
    which continued after Christ, did the Apostles relieve and set at
    liberty, through the influence and virtue of the promise of the Son of
    God (to wit) <i>the Holy Ghost</i>, or <i>the Comforter</i>, which could not come
    until he went away: And on the day of <i>Pentecost</i>, whilst they waited
    in humility for the fulfilling of his promise, the very effect of
    Christs birth and sufferings did first manifest it self, when the Holy
    Ghost sprung up amongst them, to the destruction of Sin and Satan.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Under Apostacies.</span>11. And so long as the purity of Christianity continued in the
    Primitive Church, there were very few that the Devil could personally
    or actually lay hold of in the Astral Man, for the space of two
    hundred years after the death of Christ, until that from Meekness and
    Abstinence, the Christians began to exalt themselves in Loftiness and
    Worldly Honours; then the Devil began to exalt his head amongst the
    Lip-Christians, bewitching them into every Lust; and captivating their
    inward and outward faculties at his pleasure. As all along in Popery is
    clearly seen.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Under Idolatry.</span>12. Yet
    notwithstanding, the coming of Christ hath prevented the Devils
    force in general. Such Nations as have never embraced the Christian
    Faith, are still deluded and bewitched by him; because the center hath
    never been actually awakened in any of them, so that the Devils power
    prevails over them mightily, to seduce them to worship things visible,
    and not the true God: For where the most darkness is in Religion
    and Worship, or in natural understanding, there his power is most
    predominant; As in <i>Tartary</i>, <i>China</i>, and the <i>East-Indies</i>; also in
    <i>Lapland</i>, <i>Finland</i>, and the <i>Northern Islands</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">How power in new-discovered Lands.</span>13. In the <i>West-Indies</i> or <i>America</i>, his access is very facil and
    freequent to the Inhabitants, so that by custom and continuance they
    were at the first discovery thereof, become so much substitute and
    obsequious to his power, that though they knew him to be a power of
    Darkness, yet they adored him lest he should destroy them and their
    Children. And unto such a height were they come at the Landing of
    <i>Cortes</i>, <i>Drake</i>, and <i>Vandernort</i>, that they could familiarly convert
    themselves into Wolves, Bears, and other furious Beasts; in which
    Metamorphosis their <i>Enthusiasms</i> and <i>Divinations</i> were suggested, and
    such were held in greatest esteem.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">His power in <i>America</i>.</span>14. Till upon the Invasion of the <i>Spaniards</i>, the greater evil drove
    out the less, and the cruel Murthers of that Antichristian tradition,
    did both depopulate the Islands and most of the Continent; and also by
    accident, though not through any good intention, extirpate
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span> the race
    of such as addicted themselves to this infamous sort of Divination. In
    which devastation, and bloody inquisition, their Idols were discovered
    with their Oracles and Inchantments, far different from the <i>European</i>
    Conjurers, and any of their Ceremonies.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The variety of Conjurations according to the Countries.</span>15. But that which is the most remarkable in the Infernal proceedings,
    is this, That there is not any Nation under the Sun, but the Devil hath
    introduced himself amongst them through their Ceremonies and Worship,
    though quite opposite to one another: For in the Kingdom of <i>China</i>,
    by the sacrifice of <i>Blood</i> and <i>Panaak</i>, he is Conjured and Exorcized
    through the repetitions of several Superstitious Invocations to the
    Sun and Moon. In <i>Tartary</i> the Magicians go quite another way to work,
    with Offerings to the Ocean, to the Mountains, and the Rivers, fuming
    Incense, and divers sorts of Feathers; by which means the Devils are
    compelled to appear. So that we see how this <i>Proteus</i> can dispose
    himself in the divers Kingdoms of this World; being called by other
    names in <i>Tartary</i>, <i>China</i>, the <i>East</i> and <i>West-Indies</i>, &amp;c. then
    amongst the <i>European</i> Conjurers. Likewise the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>
    could Invocate Spirits by Prayers unto the Moon, and divers Sacrifices
    of Milk, Honey, Vervine, and Blood. And those that are addicted to
    Conjurations in Christianity, have attained to a more lofty and ample
    manner of Incantation and Conjuring with Magical Garments, Fire,
    Candles, Circles, Astrological Observations, Invocations, and holy
    Names of God, according to the <i>Kaballa</i> of the <i>Jews</i>./</p>

  <p><span class="snp"><b>59.</b></span><span class="sni">Why few are able to raise Spirits.</span>
    16. So that every distinct Nation hath conformed its Conjuration unto
    the Ceremonies of that Religion which it professeth: And it is to be
    observed, That from a natural cause every Nation hath its Conjurations
    and Names of Devils, from the Constellation under which the Countrey
    lyeth, and from the Air or Wind to which such particular Dominations
    do belong; so that no effect would follow, if one Countrey should
    traditionally inure themselves to the Forms and Exorcisms that are
    used by another Nation. And therefore is it that so many attempts are
    offered in vain amongst professed Christians to raise Spirits, because
    they have little or nothing from their own Constellation, but make
    use of what they have borrowed from the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>, or the
    ancient Imbecillity of the <i>Ægyptians</i> Priests; I mean, their simple
    forms of Invocation.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The Names of Devils in the Time of the Law.</span>17. But because we are rather upon the discovery of the Infernal
    Kingdom, as it hath no dependence upon the doings of mortal Men;
    therefore we will proceed to discover what the Antients have said
    concerning it: So the next which we fall upon after the description of
    their Habitations, and the manner of their Appearances, is their Names
    and Appellations diversly considered. First, from the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span> Creation of the
    World to the coming of Christ, they retained the <i>Hebrew</i> names, as
    <span class="gothic">Belial, Baal, Baalzebub, Lelah, Ador, Abaddon</span>, &amp;c. according to
    the <i>seculum</i> under which they were Invocated; assuming names according
    to the present occasion about which they were imployed.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their Names in <i>China</i>.</span>18. Under the Constellation of <i>China</i>, they are Invocated by the Names
    <span class="gothic">Kan, Sinoam, Nantam, Bal, Baltal, Sheall</span>, the six Governours or
    Presidents: <span class="gothic">Chancangian</span>, the chief of the Devils: <span class="gothic">Po, Paym,
    Nalkin, Nebo</span>, the Devils of the four Winds: <span class="gothic">Lean, Lan, Pan,
    Adal</span>, the Devils of the four Elements. And according to the nature
    of their language or words which do all consist of no more then one
    syllable, so are the Devils named. Yea, as it is conjectured by many
    learned Magicians, this language of the <i>Chinenses</i> is more Magical and
    adapted to Conjurations, then all the <i>Oriental Tongues</i>, because of
    the consonancy and copiousness thereof, together with the numerous and
    various Characters used by them.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">In the <i>East-Indies<br />Tartaria.<br />Greece.<br />Italy.<br />West
    Indies.</i></span>19. In the <i>East-Indies</i>, and in <i>Tartary</i>, the Names are the same
    with those of <i>China</i>, though the Ceremonies differ. In <i>Persia</i>,
    <i>Arabia</i>, <i>Natolia</i>, <i>Ægypt</i>, <i>Æthiopia</i>, the Names are the same with
    the <i>Jewish Rabbins</i>. But the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i> have different from
    the rest, according to their Language and Superstitions. The <i>Turks</i>,
    <i>Muscovites</i>, <i>Russians</i>, <i>Lapponians</i>, and <i>Norwegians</i>, make use of
    the <i>Sclavonian</i> tongue in all their Conjurations. The <i>West-Indians</i>
    have very strange and antick Names and Ceremonies of their own, nothing
    depending on the Traditions and Practices of the old World; for, as
    is related before, the Devil is sufficiently capable of introducing
    himself through the Religious Superstitions of any Nation whomsoever,
    according to the Constellations, although strangers to the Rites and
    Ceremonies of others.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The nature of their Names.</span>20. But though their Names be conformable to the Language and Climate
    of that Nation where they are raised or called; yet have they divers
    Names, suppose twenty or thirty to one Devil, according to the several
    ministrations they have had from the Creation to this day, leaving a
    several name behinde them at each of their appearances upon the earth;
    for, according to the testimony of the Devil himself, if credit may be
    given to Devils, they, as they are abstractively considered in their
    own Kingdom, have no imposed Names of distinction, but are forced
    to assume them when they rise up in the external principle of this
    World: although in some measure it must be granted, that there be some
    principal Kings and Dukes in the Infernal Hierarchy, that have Names
    establish’d upon them which cannot be transferr’d or altered.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The names of [<i>sic</i>] Devils in <i>Scot</i>.</span>
    21. As for the Names that are recorded in this precedent <i>Discovery</i>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
    <i>of Witchcraft</i> by <i>Reginald Scot</i> Esq; being a Catalogue of Devils in
    their Rancks/<span class="snp"><b>60.</b></span> and Hierarchies, they are supposed to be fictitious and
    totally imaginary, being taken out of <i>Bodin</i> or <i>Wyerus</i>, which they
    recorded from the mouth of Tradition, and obscure Manuscrips:*<span class="sni">[* <i>sic</i>]</span> And
    indeed were there any certainty in this List of Devils, it were to be
    preferred as the most ample and exact delineation that is extant. But
    it is the rather to be suspected, because of the little coherence it
    hath with the former received Names of Devils eitheir in <i>Europe</i>,
    <i>Asia</i>, <i>Africa</i>, or <i>America</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The names of Damned souls.</span>22. But if we would speak of Damned Souls and their Names or
    Appellations, they are farr otherwise to be considered then the Devils;
    for such as their imposed Names were here on earth, such is the Name
    they have in the Kingdom of Darkness, after a Magical manner, according
    to the language of nature in the first principle of Darkness; as the
    Saints in heaven retain their Names in a Cœlestial manner: And also, as
    the Astral Spirit of a Man deceased, retains its antient Name according
    to the Astral source in the principle of the one only Element.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Whence the names of Devils are.</span>
    23. For as the language of Nature is found in the second Principle,
    it is likewise manifest in the dark Worlds property, according to the
    first Principle of Wrath; as also the monstrous shapes of Devils and
    Damned Souls is correspondent to the Magical postures of their Souls
    whilst they were alive; of which I shall speak more largely when their
    Shapes are to be described. According unto which, as also according to
    the rest of their attributes, <i>viz.</i> their <i>Rancks, Numbers, Times,
      Powers, Places</i>, &amp;c. their Names are fitted and conformed according to
    the uniformity of name and thing in the principles of the eternal and
    external nature.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The names of Devils in the Kingdom of <i>Fiacim</i>.</span>24. And as all other Nations have their various Appellations for
    Devils and Damned Souls, like their natural tone or language; so we
    can mention one Kingdom more admirable then the rest, <i>viz.</i> the
    Kingdom of <i>Fiacim</i> at the <i>Northern Pole</i>, where all the Counsellors
    are Magicians; and the Names which they use in Invocations, are
    Mathematically disposed in a wonderful harmony and efficacy, to the
    performance of Magical operations. So much of the Places and Names
    of Infernal Beings; the next to be considered is their Shapes and
    Likenesses.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The Shapes of Devils.</span>25. The Shapes of Devils are answerable to the cause of their Fall, and
    the Dominions to which they belong. Those that belong to the Supreme
    Hierarchy, when they are called by Magicians, do at first appear in the
    form of fierce and terrible Lyons, vomiting fire, and roaring hideously
    about the Circle; from thence they convert themselves into Serpents,
    Monkies, and other Animals, till the Magician
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span> do repeat the form
    of Constriction or Confinement to a Trine or Triangle, as before is
    mentioned in the Fifteenth Book of the <i>Discovery</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">As they appear to Magicians in the highest rank.</span>
    26. After the Conjuration is repeated, they forsake these bestial
    shapes, and *indow<span class="sni">[* = indue]</span> the humane form at first like troops of Armed
    Men; till at last by frequent repetitions of other Ceremonies, they
    appear as naked Men of gentle countenance and behaviour. Yet is the
    Magician to take care that they deceive him not by insinuations; for
    their fraudulency is unspeakable in their appearance and dealings with
    Mankind; because we may be assured they appear not willingly, but are
    by forceable Conjurations compelled: so that they will ever minde their
    own ends in medling with man; that is, to deprave his minde, or subvert
    the Lives and Estates of others through his means and assistance.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">In the lower orders.</span>27. The rest of the Infernal Dominions have various appearances. The
    two next Orders affect to represent the beautiful colours of Birds, and
    Beasts, as Leopards, Tygers, Pecocks, <i>&amp;c.</i> But by Conjurations they
    may be likewise reduced to a Manlike form, wherein they will readily
    answer every demand within the compass of their capacity, answerable to
    the Order unto which they belong: Yet many of them appear in Monstrous
    forms, and can hardly be conjured to desert them. Though the Exorcist
    Charm them never so wisely,/<span class="snp"><b>61.</b></span> they will shew him a pair of Crocodiles
    jaws, or a Lyons paw, with other dreadful menaces, enough to terrifie
    any Novice from such Damnable Injunctions as the practice of Magick.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">That the Devils are answerable to the unclean Beasts.</span>28. But more especially, the opinion of the antients is, That according
    to the division of the clean and unclean Beasts in the Law given unto
    <i>Moses</i>, the Shapes of Devils are disposed in the Infernal Kingdom:
    So that the most perverse and potent amongst the Devils represent
    the most ugly and mischievous amongst the Beasts, according to this
    following division; <i>viz.</i> such Devils as <span class="gothic">Astaroth, Lucifer,
    Bardon, Pownok</span>, who incline men and instigate them to pride and
    presumptuousness, have the shapes of Horses, Lyons, Tygars, Wolves.
    Such as instigate to Lust and Covetousness have the forms of Hogs,
    Serpents, and other filthy reptiles or envious Beasts, as Dogs, Cats,
    Vultures, Snakes, <i>&amp;c.</i> Such as incline to Murther, have the shapes
    of every Bird and Beast of prey. Such as Answer Questions humane in
    Philosophy, or Religion, have more tolerable shapes, almost manly,
    but with crooked Noses, like Mermaids, or Satyres. And of all the
    rest it is to be observed, that as not one single Lust or Vice hath
    dominion without mixture in the evil Spirits, so they are not of a
    distinct shape lik one single Beast, but compounded into Monsters, with
    Serpents-tails, four eyes, many feet and horns, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span></p>

  <p><span class="sni">The shapes of Damned Souls.</span>29.
    And as in general, these are the shapes of Devils, so the
    particular shapes of Damned Souls are to be considered in the same
    manner with the rest, only with this difference, that they are more
    addicted to metamorphose themselves and vary their appearances. Though,
    for the most part, the Damned Souls retain the humane shape after a
    Magical manner, so that the greatest part of that numberless number are
    in their antient shapes, especially when they appear in sleep to their
    surviving acquaintance. Their aspects are very dismal and melancholy
    like the Ghosts of the Astral source.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their times and seasons.</span>30. Now to speak of the Times and Seasons of their Appearance. The
    better sort of Magicians to square their times with Astrological hours,
    especially of <i>Saturn</i>, <i>Luna</i>, and <i>Venus</i>, in the Moons increase,
    and the middle of the night, or twelve a clock at noon: In which hours
    they do likewise compose their Garments, Caps, Candlesticks, Figures,
    Lamins, Pentacles, and Circles for Conjuration. As for the Times in
    respect of their Infernal Courses, the fittest are when they spring up
    in the Wrath, or when they sink in the Dispair, which is a mystery to
    the learned Conjurers of <i>Europe</i>.</p>

  <p> <span class="sni">Their places of appearance.</span>31. In respect of this exterior World, they can most easily appear
    in solitary places, when the Sun is down; for they are naturally at
    enmity with the Sun, because it stands as a type of the Mediator, or
    Heart and Centre which they lost utterly in their fall, and now are
    destitute of, like a wheel without an axletree. And indeed, the want
    of this is the chief cause of all their torment, and of the rising of
    the gnawing Worm, when they consider of their irrevocable sentence, and
    irrecoverable loss.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">When Tempests reign.</span>32. In storms of Hail, or Snow, Wind, Tempest, and Lightning, is
    accounted amongst Magicians, a time for Conjuring at an easie rate. And
    they say, That such Ceremonies will prove very effectual, if a Conjurer
    begin his Exorcisms in the hour and day of <i>Luna</i>, in the middest of a
    furious storm of Lightning, Rain, and Thunder, in a low Vault or Celler
    that is close and retired. Also when the Wind blows high, without Rain,
    they say, the Devils are more near the Kingdom of this World, and may
    with great facility be sollicited or raised at such a season, because
    they delight in all extremities of weather, being themselves the first
    cause of the disorder of the properties in the Kingdom of Nature.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">According to the situation of Regions.</span>33. But in some Countries they can more easily appear then in others,
    according to the Constellations, for they delight much in the
    extremities of the two Poles toward <i>Lapland</i>, <i>Nova Zembla</i>, <i>Greenland</i>,
    <i>Tartary</i>; and in the <i>South</i> towards the Islands scattered about the
    confines of <i>Terra Incognita</i>. They are likewise easily Invocated on
    the shoar amongst lofty Rocks and Precipices, or in/
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span> Deserts and
    Wildernesses far from Towns or Inhabitants.<span class="sni"><b>62</b>.</span> And it is said, they do
    much respect the motion of the Seas in their appearance unto such as
    solicite them in places <i>Maritime</i> or <i>Plagiary</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their Ranks and Orders.</span>34. As for their Rancks or Orders, there is some difficulty in the true
    discovery thereof, by reason that we know not certainly of what Orders
    they were that <i>Fell</i>. The opinion of most men is, <i>That of every Order
      many fell</i>. But those that better know the nature of the Heavenly
    Hierarchies, have sufficiently proved, <i>That of any Ranck or Order
      none can fall unless all do follow</i>. Therefore with more reason may it
    be judged, That before the Devils fell, the Hierarchy of Heaven did
    consist of three Rancks or Orders; to wit, the Order of <span class="gothic">Uriel</span>,
    of <span class="gothic">Michael</span>, of <span class="gothic">Lucifer</span>: That of <span class="gothic">Lucifer</span> is totally
    in <i>Hell</i>: The other which is under <span class="gothic">Michael</span>, is the dominion of
    <i>Heaven</i>: The last which is <span class="gothic">Uriels</span>, are more in the dominion
    of this third principle of the <i>Stars</i>, having the <i>Planets</i> in their
    dominion, with the influences thereof.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">In three distinctions.</span>35. So that the foregoing Catalogue, transcribed by the Author of this
    <i>Discovery</i>, is utterly feigned and fictitious, because it makes these
    many sorts of Devils to have Dominion over several Legions in several
    distinctions of <i>Seraphims</i>, <i>Powers</i>, <i>Thrones</i>, <i>Dominations</i>,
    <i>Cherubims</i>, &amp;c. Whereas the whole Kingdom of Hell consists but of one
    only Hierarchy, which is that of <span class="gothic">Lucifer</span> and his <i>Legions</i>,
    reduced by their exorbitances into that Lacrymable posture wherein they
    now are and shall be for ever. Which Doctrine seriously weigh’d will
    prove the attempts of Conjurers and Magicians to be utterly vain, and
    their forms of Invocation vanity and falshood.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their numbers.</span>36. Their number may be thought upon more narrowly, if we consider that
    they consist of one Hierarchy and no more; yet must we confess that the
    limit is not to be put thereunto, because their nature is to Germinate
    and Multiply as they please, contracting and dilating themselves
    according to the force of their imaginative powers and faculties.
    But although this be granted, yet there is a setled number of Devils
    that varyeth not. Though of Damned Souls the number is numberless and
    unfathomable; yet as to their extent of room or place, it is never the
    more because of their multitude, they being able to truss a thousand
    Legions into the carcass of a man. As for the opinions of Authors, they
    are various; it is believed by some, <i>That the Starrs are answerable to
    their number</i>; others speak of <i>the Sands upon the Seashore</i>: however
    it be, this is certain, <i>They are even innumerable in respect of humane
    Capacities</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their natures and properties.</span>37. Their Natures are now to be considered as they belong to the
    hellish source or quality. In themselves they rest not, neither are
    they capable of the length or shortness of time, nor of the alternate
    courses of day and night. The wickedness which they committed in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>
    this life, are their continual torment, which do Magically gnaw and
    corrode them, rising and boyling up perpetually within them, all the
    refrigeration which they have, is by intercourse when the height of
    Wickedness begins to stirr them in blasphemies against God, and towring
    up above heaven and goodness, in their adulterated Imaginations, which
    is unto them as sport and pastime with one another, and lasteth such
    a space as with us makes up forty minutes. Neither doth this any whit
    advantage them, <span class="sni">Their torments</span>but rather adds to their torment; for pain discontinued
    is the greater: neither would vexation be vexation, if it had no
    respite or forbearance; That the contrary might be also manifest,
    <i>Nam contraria juxta se posita majus elucescunt</i>. Yet is their
    torment exceedingly different, so that the torment of one, in respect
    of another, is but a Dream or Phansie; I mean, amongst the Damned
    Souls, and not the Devils, for the pain and sorrow of the Devils is
    greater then the greatest of the lost Souls, by many thousand degrees,
    according to the course of nature and reason; for that which falls
    highest, suffers most, and <i>optima corrupta fiunt pessima</i>./</p>

  <p><span class="snp"><b>63.</b></span><span class="sni">The Variety thereof.</span>38. But wonderful and manifold are the torments which all in general
    of the Infernal troops, do suffer according to the various lusts they
    reigned in whilst they lived upon the earth. The cruel Murtherers
    that died in the boyling source of blood and envy, their torment is
    the greatest, they are continually Murthering in their imaginations,
    and seeking, like dreaming men, to do what the want of the Organ will
    not suffer them; for according to the saying of the wisest upon this
    Subject, this is the torment and misery of all the Damned, <i>That they
    are continually wishing and woulding; and in wouldings they generate
    Ideas and representations, which are the species of their continual
    aggravations and deceiving phansies</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The Nature thereof.</span>39. Those that were buryed in Lust and Gluttony, Drunkenness and
    Lasciviousness, are also in miserable torments, yet much inferiour to
    the first; they are continually imagining their former pleasures in the
    <i>Magia</i> as in a dream, which when they wake, torments them cruelly;
    they are often hanging, stabbing, and mangling themselves for love,
    and perpetually sinking down in sorrow and despair, if they were such
    as died in love, or in the height of their Astral affections, leaving
    behind them a heap of desires and lusts, which are the only cause of
    all their torment. And we may well compare the passions of Melancholy
    persons, or such as in Deserts, Woods, and Mountains, pine away for
    love of Women, unto their torments; which indeed being the trouble of
    the mind, are absolutely the greatest and heaviest that the source or
    property of this World affordeth, I mean, the perturbations of the
    minde in general.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their torment in the source of Anger.</span>
    40. Such souls in whom the boyling source of Anger and Rage,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span> hath
    had a dwelling or receptacle, if they depart unmortified, do also
    enter into a most dreadful kind of torment, which continually ariseth
    as a biting Worm and hungry fire to double and accumulate the excess
    of despair upon them, if they have much domineered therein whilst
    they lived in this World. Also these that reigned in Pride and Envy,
    are ever seeking to pluck God from his Throne, and towring up in
    their Imaginations, as men that dream, still seeking for the Kingdom
    of heaven, to insult and boast therein; but the quality thereof is
    utterly occult and estranged from them; so that they can never finde,
    taste, hear, nor see it, though it be through and through with their
    own peculiar principle. This adds perpetually to their misery, and
    ariseth at times with horrible pangs and gnawings, like the irksome and
    vexatious pains and aches subject to Mans body, which cease a while and
    then begin to shoot and ake by intercourse, as the Gowt, Tooth-ach,
    Head-ach, Convulsion, Gripings, and the Stone.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">In all the five Senses.</span>41. Thus their torments are in brief described, but indeed the capacity
    of Man is not able to reach the description of their cruel miseries,
    and continual pangs which they contracted upon themselves; for every
    faculty is sufficiently plagued. The Sence of Hearing is disturb’d
    with harsh and rugged sounds, which are as an antipathy to that Organ;
    as rough and scraping sounds externally offend the ears, and set the
    teeth on edge, by affecting the tender fibres of the same. Their Sight
    is likewise cruelly offended and affrighted with monstrous appearances
    and Ideas represented continually to their imaginations. And there is
    not any loathsome taste in the Kingdome of this World, either Animal,
    Vegetative, or Mineral, which they are at any time void of, being
    continually pestered and suffocated with filthy fumes and smoaks of
    hellish fruits, as of Sulphurean stinks, and abominations.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">By their acquaintance on earth.</span>
    42. Neither are the other Sences of the Touch and Smell behind in
    participation of the like Torments, which their own iniquities do
    perpetually excite and create unto them; besides, they are ever
    vexing one another; and if any be in the same misery with whom they
    had acquaintance here on *eath,<span class="sni">[* <i>read</i>, earth]</span> the very Magical knowledge,
    and perceivance, or remembrance thereof, doth beyond utterance or
    conception, most miserably afflict and macerate their Souls and all
    their Sences./</p>

  <p><span class="snp"><b>64.</b></span><span class="sni">The Nature of Hell.</span>43. For the nature of their habitation is such, that their torment
    is exceedingly aggravated thereby, because the extremity of the four
    Elements is there converted into a whole Principle of wrath and
    vexation. The excess of cold and heat, drought and moisture, are
    continually raging amongst them by intercourse. Neither is there any
    light or lustre to be seen within their Courts, but that which
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span>comes
    from their fiery Eyes, as a deadly glance or glimmering, being sudden
    fiery flashes and sparkling, as the enkindling of Gunpowder, or <i>Aurum
    fulminans</i> for a similitude.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The food of Devils.</span>44. And as every kinde of Being feeds upon somewhat of its own nature,
    property, and element, whither it be Plant, Animal, or Metalline kinde;
    so the Devils are neither destitute of meat, drink, nor cloathing,
    according to their own Kingdom and quality, having fruits springing
    and growing before them of hellish, sour and poysonous natures, which
    are real and palpable unto them, and not imaginary or typical, though
    to us magical and invisible; neither is this to be wondered at, if we
    consider the nature of Man’s Soul, <i>In Media Natura</i>; for if it feed
    not upon the internal*<span class="sni">[* ? eternal]</span> and substantial Word, which is the very
    Bread of Life it self, it must of necessity ruminate on something else,
    <i>viz.</i> the fruits of Iniquity, which it takes in and drinketh up as
    the Oxe drinks water, so that to the soul the sin becomes palpable,
    glutting, and satiating; yea, so substantial unto the Soul, as Dirt or
    Ink upon fair white Linnen is to our external Eyes; neither can the
    Soul be freed from these spots till the water above the Firmament wash
    them away.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their food in the Astral source.</span>45. Also in respect of the Astral source they are not destitute of
    food, when they bring themselves into the same; for the gas of the air
    and bias of the water is their nourishment, while they stay here, as
    is before alledged: These influences of the air and water they take
    into their <i>Limbus</i>, and convert into their own poysonous natures; as
    of sweet and wholsome herbs the filthy Toads and other venemous Beasts
    do make their poyson, converting them into a nature like themselves.
    And on the contrary, the poysonous herbs are converted into good and
    wholesome nourishment by other cleanly Beasts.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their Speech.</span>46. And as the Infernal Troops are considered in respect of the
    four Elements, they have a distinct and peculiar tone or language,
    which they exercise and speak one amongst one another, as mortals
    do. But they have utterly lost the dignity of their sounds according
    to the eternal nature. And are likewise totally corrupted in their
    pronouncing, or Dialect, since they fell from their first cælestial
    glory; so that their speech is harsh, doleful, and terrible, like the
    fruits they feed upon, and the life they dwell in. Which depravation
    is very apparent in the Kingdom of this World in the divided Languages
    of every Region, according to the Constellation under which they are
    situated: The true and magical Language of nature being hid from all
    the Countreys of the earth.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">What Language they affect.</span>
    47. But when they appear in the outward Elements, they do many times
    express themselves in <i>Irish</i>, <i>Welch</i>, <i>Latine</i>; or <i>Russian</i>, which
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>
    are the Languages most affected by them to answer unto Conjurations,
    or Compacts. So that if any Magician, who is ignorant of these
    aforesaid Languages do at any time Raise or Exorcise such Spirits,
    he must be mindful to confine them to his mother tongue; least their
    gibberish prove altogether unintelligible; for as every thing appears
    in what it most affecteth, or is addicted to; even so the Spirits have
    their distinct affections, passions, and postures, both in word, habit,
    shape, and gesture; so that the Magician must be wary in Exorcizing
    with them, that he confine them to a different place, posture, shape,
    and language, to answer their intentions without impediment.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their unconstancy.</span>48. For they are very variable and unconstant in their dealings with
    mankind, nor will they stand to any thing that hath not bound them by
    the obligations of Words, Characters, and Imprecations, except the
    skill of the Exorcist be such, that he is able to confine them into a
    Magical Triad, which hath the certain force of obliging or compelling
    them to utter truth, and nothing false in/<span class="snp"><b>65.</b></span> all their Answers, or
    Informations. But with such miserable men and women as they have made
    Covenants and Indentures for body, soul, and works; with such I say,
    they keep no faith, nor are they lyable to their commands; but on the
    contrary, have them hampered and subjected to their will and power,
    till they have terminated their lives in their destruction.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their Power.</span>49. Yet have not any of the most potent Princes in the Hellish Power,
    the least ability to destroy the least of the sons of men, without
    the consent of the mind and senses of the Soul; for until the will of
    the Soul be opened unto him, his threatnings, sleights and stratagems
    are without any power or force, as the nerves of a dead man. Although
    naturally every evil Spirit boasteth, as if all the world were at its
    command, and every Soul were subject to its authority and beck, with
    the Goods or Possessions of the external World.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">When they are called up.</span>50. When any evil Spirit is raised up by Conjurations, without
    League, or Compact; these Spirits so raised, are exceeding fraudulent
    and deceitful, as stubborn servants that do their Masters will by
    constraint, and not by any natural act of obedience unto his Commands.
    But with such as they have compacted, they are frequent and officious,
    imploying them as Agents for the destruction of others and their
    substance: and being marryed unto such, they are even become one with
    them, being incorporated into them, so that they are nothing different
    from incarnate Devils, save that the spark of divine Light, which was
    the gift of God unto repentance, is not totally eradicated until the
    body fall away.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Fumigations made unto them.</span>51. From such as Covenant with these unconstant Spirits, do they
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>
    daily obtain Fumigations, Odours, and Offerings, or Sacrifices of
    Blood, Fire, Wine, Ointments, Incense, Fruits, Excrements, Herbs,
    Gums, Minerals, and other Ingredients, by which from a Magical cause,
    they have more influence and authority over the bewitched party to
    insinuate into their affection, peircing even through their bones and
    marrow, till they have so habituated them to their service, that the
    same becomes their daily bread and sole delight in accomplishing every
    villany and abomination which the malicious and subtle instigation of
    Satan leads them to.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The Conclusion.</span>52. Thus have I Essayed to illustrate the Natures of Infernal Beings,
    which notwithstanding is a Subject so intricate and copious in it
    self, that great difficulty accompanies the Explication thereof; by
    reason of the variety of their natures in the source of darkness,
    wherein they live, move, eat, breath, and inhabit, having qualities,
    actions, and passions innumerable, to us men-kinde utterly unknown and
    incomprehensible: So that to attempt an ample demonstration of this
    present Subject, would require deeper speculation then the matter doth
    deserve, in regard that there be so many <i>Protei</i> and Changlings in
    that gloomy Kingdom, who do never stay or continue in the same nature,
    property, and form for an hour together; but may be compared to the
    swiftness of the Windes, or the likeness and form of swift running
    Waters, that pass away as a thought; and are no more remembered. So
    it is with the Spirits of Darkness, whose life is a meer anguish and
    inconstancy from one sorrow to another unto all Eternity./</p>

    attempts of novices in Conjuration, they are accompanyed with noises,
    tremblings, flashes, howlings, and most dreadful shriekes, till after
    further progress and experience therein they approach nearer unto this
    Elemental nature, till by degrees they can manifestly be apparent unto
    their Exorcist.</p>

  <p>2. When <i>Chiancungi</i>,<span class="sni">A Relation of a Magician.</span> and his sister <i>Napala</i>, did first attempt to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span>
    call up Spirits, they begun with the Spirit
    <span class="gothic">Bokim</span>, in the
    twentieth degree: they hung a vault under ground with black both on the
    top and bottom, lining it therewith; and having drawn the Circle of the
    Order of Thrones, with the seven Planets, and their Magical Characters
    in the Center, they proceeded to the Ceremonies of Conjuration after
    they had frequently repeated the forms of calling, and nothing as yet
    appeared; they were grown so desperate therein, that forsaking the
    Circle, and every defensive Character or Ceremony, they at last betook
    themselves to the most accursed and detestable branch of Magick, which
    consists of Compacts, or Confederacy; and having by a solemn League
    summoned the aforesaid Spirit <span class="gothic">Bokim</span>, they obtain’d 155. years
    from the Spirit, Covenanting therewith for body, soul, and works.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">His Actions.</span>3. In which damned life they continued exercising strange wonders in
    every Countrey. By the help of this Magician the <i>Tartars</i> did destroy
    above 100 sail of Ships belonging unto <i>China</i>; many losses did he
    bring upon that Kingdom in their Children, Fruits, Corn, Silk, and
    Navigation; he could frequently transport himself through the Air, and
    carry in one hand a thousand pound weight, to the astonishment of all
    that knew him. He had many publick contests with Magicians of other
    Countries, being tryals of skill in Magical Art, wherein he was said to
    excel all that ever went before him.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Another Magician.</span>4. Such another was <i>Lewis Gaufridi</i> a <i>French</i> Priest, who had
    compacted with the Devil, and served him 14 years in these detestable
    works, sacrificing Infants unto him, worshipping him in a filthy shape,
    and tempting others to their Magical society or nocturnal Conventions;
    in which, as it is reported, they did ever feast and junket with
    varieties and dainties, which though they did seem delectable, were yet
    notwithstanding gustless and unsavoury.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">What Charms are.</span>5. Leaving these relations, something shall be said of <i>Charms</i> and
    <i>Spells</i>, as they are divided in this following manner; first, such
    Amulets as being engraven and molded in the fashion of Money, or Coyn,
    do serve to provoke any one desired unto love and familiarity, being
    hung about the neck in certain Planetary hours. Secondly, Spells or
    Charms in Parchment with Magical Characters, as Periapts to Cure
    diseases; to make one valiant, memorative, and constant. Thirdly,
    Corselets, which are an ancient <i>Danish</i> Charm of Neck-laces, composed
    of Thunderstones ingraven with Magical Letters, to resist all noxious
    influences, and the danger of Lightning.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Pentacles.</span>6. <i>Pentacles</i> are a fourth sort of appendix, which Conjurers,
    Charmers, and Magicians use, being made with five corners, according to
    the five Senses, and the operation thereof inscribed upon the corners;
    the matter whereof they are composed, is fine Linnen
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span> doubled, and done
    with Cere-cloth between. This figure the Magician holds in his hand,
    lifting it up from the skirt of his Garment to which it is annexed,
    when Spirits that are raised are stubborn and rebellious, refusing to
    be conformable unto the Ceremonies and Rites of Magick.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their force.</span>7. Also by the holding forth of <i>Pentacles</i>, with these words,
    <span class="gothic">Glauron, Amor,/ Amorula, Beor, Beorka, Beroald, Anepheraton</span>,
    <span class="snp"><b>67.</b></span>
    repeated at the instant. The evil Spirits that possess the bodies of
    bewitched people are cruelly tortured and amazed, being by the frequent
    repetition thereof forced at last to depart by the assistance of the
    Exorcism of the sixth Cannon for the order of Seraphims.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Telesms.</span>8. When Magicians exercise Conjuration by Moon-light in the Mountains
    or Valleys, they have another sort of Charm by way of Telesms, which
    they bury within a hundred paces of the place where the Circle is
    composed towards the <i>East</i>, <i>West</i>, <i>North</i>, and <i>South</i>; For such
    spells have the secret power to hinder any living creature for coming
    near them, till their Exercize be done, except the Infernal Spirit,
    whose presence they do so ardently desire.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">For Diseases.</span>9. Such <i>Spells</i> as are made in some Edible matter, with <i>Characters
    upon them</i>, are given for <i>Agues</i>, <i>Head-ach</i>, <i>Epilepsie</i>, <i>Mother</i>,
    &amp;c. Especially being powerful in operation, when the party is ignorant
    of the Charm taken in; many such I know have taken wonderful effect.
    But as for <i>Philtres</i>, <i>Potions</i>, and <i>Love-cups</i>, they proceed rather
    from a natural cause; whether their effects be to afflict with Diseases
    to Poyson, or to provoke unto Love of a Party whom they disdain:
    Neither are such to be numbered amongst Charms; because their effect is
    meerly natural, from a natural cause.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Fumigations.</span>10. But to insist further upon the nature of Conjuration, Magicians do
    much exercise their time in <i>Fumigations</i> unto those Spirits whom they
    are about to provoke; their fumes being distributed according to the
    nature of the Spirit under any of the seven Planets, which the antient
    Conjurers were very punctual in observing, though in these days it be
    much forgot, as superfluous, or rather dangerous to insert amongst the
    Ceremonies of Conjuration. A division of Fumigations according to the
    Influence of the Planets, and Orders of Spirits, we will here set down
    in this manner.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">For <i>Saturn</i>.</span>11. <i>Fumigations</i> for <i>Saturn</i> are made of Frankincense Trees,
    Pepperwort Rooots,*<span class="sni">[* <i>sic</i>]</span> Storax, and Galbanum; by these the Spirits
    <span class="gothic">Marbas</span>, <span class="gothic">Corban</span>, <span class="gothic">Stilkon</span>, <span class="gothic">Idos</span>, &amp;c. And all
    of the first order in the astringency are appeased and provoked, when
    the <i>fumes</i> are put upon a <i>Tripod</i> in the hour of <i>Saturn</i> according
    to the Planetary division. These <i>Fumigations</i> make these Spirits
    appear like old men, with promiss beards, and meager looks; like
    Serpents, Cats, Wolves, Badgers, Panthers; like old Men in Armour; like
    Trumpeters in many ranks and divisions.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span></p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Jupiter.</i></span>12. For Spirits under <i>Jupiter</i>, they take Lignum Aloes, Ashen-Keys,
    Benjamin, Storax, Peacocks-feathers, and <i>Lapis Lazuli</i>, mixing the
    same with the blood of a Stork, a Swallow, or a Hart; the brains being
    also added. The <i>fumes</i> are kindled in <i>Jupiters</i> hour, and in a place
    appropriate to his nature. And by this sacrifice the Spirits of the
    next order are called up, like glorious Kings with many attendants, and
    mighty pomp; with Heralds before them, and Ensign-bearers, Trumpeters,
    Guards, and all sorts of musical Instruments.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Mars.</i></span>13. They make <i>Fumigations</i> unto such Spirits of the order of Powers,
    as are under <i>Mars</i>, in the Planetary division with Aromatick Gum,
    Bdellium, Euphorbium, Load-stone, Hellebore white and black, and
    an addition of Sulphur to make them into an Amalgama, with Man’s
    blood, and the blood of a black Cat; which mixtures are said to be
    exceeding magical: so that without any other addition, they say, this
    <i>fumigation</i> is able of it self to make such Spirits to appear before
    the Exorcist; at their appearance they come with weapons brandishing,
    and shining Armour, being terrible in their looks; yet of power
    inferiour to the Spirits of <i>Saturn</i>, though they can likewise shew
    themselves as Lions, Wolves, Tygers, Bears, and all other cruel or
    ravenous Beasts.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Sol.</i></span>14. They do likewise unto the Spirits under <i>Sol</i>, being of the order
    of Thrones, <i>Suffumigate</i> Saffron, Musk, Laurel, Cinnamon, Ambergriece,
    Cloves, Myrrhe, and Frankincense, Musk, and the Balsamick Tree mixed
    up together with the brain of an Eagle, and the blood of a white Cock,
    being made up like Pills, or little Balls, and put upon the <i>Tripod</i>;
    their appearances are Castles, Gardens,/<span class="snp" id="pa_68"><b>68.</b></span> Mountains, Rivers, Fisher-men,
    Hunters, Reapers, Dogs, Sheep, Oxen, and other domestick Beasts.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Venus.</i></span>15. Under <i>Venus</i> are the Spirits of the sixth order in the Powers;
    their appearances are very stately, like the nature of the Planet; like
    Courtiers, Ladies, Princes, Queens, Infants, Children, and fragrant
    smells. The <i>fumigations</i> appropriate unto them are Roses, Coral,
    <i>Lignum Aloes</i>, and <i>Sperma Ceti</i> made up with Sparrows, brains and
    blood of Pidgeons to be fumigated with a Song.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Mercury.</i></span>16. <i>Mercury</i> sendeth Horsemen, Fishers, Labourers, Priests, Students,
    Servants, <i>&amp;c.</i> Also, Foxes, Serpents, Dogs, Hares, Hyena’s, Hydra’s,
    and other Monstrous Animals; unto him they <i>fumigate</i> Frankincense,
    Mastick, Cinkfoyl, incorporated with the brain of a Fox, and the blood
    of a Mag-Pye.</p>

  <p><span class="sni"><i>Luna.</i></span>17. Spirits under <i>Luna</i> are like Ghosts and shadows, very gastly
    to behold; though in humane shape sometimes male, sometimes female.
    <i>Fumigations</i> are offered unto them of Frogs dryed, white Poppy-seed,
    Bulls Eyes, Camphire, and Frankincense, incorporated with Gooses blood,
    and the menstruous blood of Women.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span></p>

  <p><span class="sni">Why such Ceremonies are of force.</span>18. These are the divisions of <i>fumigations</i>, neither can it be denyed,
    but that in many Ceremonies of this kind, there is great inherent
    virtue according to the Doctrines of Sympathy and Antipathy, whereby
    every thing is drawn by its like in the Idea, whither by words or
    actions, according to the saying, <i>In verbis, herbis &amp; lapidibus latet
    virtus</i>, so that the Ceremonies and Charms, with other circumstances
    used by Magicians, are doubtless prevalent to the accomplishment of
    that work which they undertake; to wit, <i>The calling up and Exorcizing
    of Infernal Spirits by Conjurations</i>.</p>

    <span class="drop-after"><span class="vat">1.</span><span class="drop-letter">B</span></span>Esides
    <span class="sni">Charms.</span>what the Author hath set down, there be many other <i>Spells</i>
    and <i>Charms</i>, which Tradition hath left unto Posterity, being many of
    them effectual for the thing intended by them, as in the precedent
    Chapter is set down, wherein the <i>Orders</i> of <i>Fumigations</i> are
    described. Besides there are <i>Magical Characters</i> attributed to the
    Planets, whereof <i>Telesms</i>, <i>Periapts</i>, <i>Amulets</i>, and <i>Philters</i>,
    are composed by <i>buryings</i>, <i>writings</i>, <i>bindings</i>, <i>engravings</i>,
    <i>alligations</i>, &amp;c. to effect various purposes in Astrological hours.
    To conquer Enemies, cure diseases, overturn Cities, stop Inundations,
    render bodies Invulnerable, and the like; which are all effected by
    medium’s of this kind, with the assistance of Imagination.</p>

  <p>2. Yet are there<span class="sni">Natural Operations.</span> many natural Compositions, which have very stupendious
    effects of themselves, without assistance of Superstition; for the
    commixtion of things is of two-fold force or vertue: First, When the
    Celestial vertues are duly disposed in any natural body; so that in
    one thing are couched various Influences of superiour Powers. The
    second is, from Artificial mixtures and Compositions of natural things
    amongst themselves, in a certain proportion to agree with the Heavens
    under certain Constellations. This proceeds from the correspondence of
    natural things amongst themselves, whereby things are effected even
    unto admiration, as <i>Agrippa</i> declares, <i>Cap.</i> 35. <i>lib.</i> 1.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Places ascribed to the seven Planets.</span>3. And as unto every Planet certain <i>fumigations</i> are ascribed; so
    unto such Spirits as are under them, certain <i>Places</i> are adopted for
    the Ceromonies*<span class="sni">[* <i>sic</i>]</span> of Conjuration, which Magicians chose when they
    set <span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>
    upon their works of Darkness. Unto <i>Saturn</i> are ascribed dark
    melancholy <i>Places</i>, Vaults, Tombes, Monasteries, empty Houses, Dens,
    Caves, Pits. Unto <i>Jupiter</i>, Theaters, Schools, Musick houses, Judgment
    seats. To <i>Mars</i>, Fields where Battels have been fought, Bakehouses,
    Glass-houses, Shambles, Places,†<span class="sni">[† <i>sic</i>]</span>
    of Execution. To <i>Sol</i>, Palaces,/<span class="snp"><b>69.</b></span>
    Mountains, Meddows, Sunshine, Groves, and upper Rooms. To <i>Venus</i>,
    Fountains, Meadows, Gardens, and the Sea-shore. Unto <i>Mercury</i>, all
    publick places belonging unto Cities. To <i>Luna</i>, Wildernesses, Woods,
    Rocks, Forrests, Ships, High-wayes, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sni">Spells.</span>4. In like manner are <i>Spells</i> and <i>Charms</i> adapted to the thing which
    they must effect, according to the matter, form and place of their
    composition; as for the <i>procuring of Love</i>, they bury Rings, Ribbons,
    Seals, Pictures, Looking-Glasses, <i>&amp;c.</i> in Stews, Baths, Beds, that in
    such places they may contract some Venereal faculty: When they gather
    Herbs or other Ingredients; they chuse the hour and place, when such
    Planets have Dominion as are over these Herbs, which they collect,
    ever remembring to turn their faces to the East, or <i>South</i>, when
    <i>Saturnine</i>, <i>Martial</i> or <i>Jovial</i> Herbs are gathered, because their
    Principal houses are Southern signs; for <i>Venereal</i>, <i>Mercurial</i>, or
    <i>Lunary</i> herbs, they must look towards the <i>West</i> or <i>North</i>, because
    their houses are chiefly Northern signs. Yet in any <i>Solar</i> or <i>Lunar</i>
    operations the body of the Sun and Moon must be respected in the
    operation.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Secret Conclusions.</span>5. Colours are also much regarded amongst Magicians, according to
    the Planet, as black, leaden, brown, unto <i>Saturn</i>; saphire, vernal,
    green, purple, golden, unto <i>Jupiter</i>; red, burning, violet, bloody,
    and iron colours unto <i>Mars</i>; golden, saffron, scarlet, <i>&amp;c.</i> unto
    the <i>Sun</i>; white, fair, green, ruddy, pleasant mixed colours unto
    <i>Venus</i>, <i>Murcury</i>, and <i>Luna</i>. In like manner they ascribe colours
    unto the twelve Houses, and according to the Planets have also certain
    compositions for fire that produce wonderful operations; as Lamps of
    Serpents skins will make Serpents to appear. Oyl that hath stood under
    Grapes, being lighted, presenteth the Chamber full of Grapes. Centaury
    and the Lapwings blood makes people seem like Gyants, and in the open
    air will make the Stars seem to move up and down in the Elements. The
    fat of a Hare lighted in a Lamp, will cause Women to be exceeding merry
    and facetious. And Candles composed of things that are <i>Saturnine</i>,
    raise terrours and melancholy in the party that lights them, and in
    those that are lighted by them.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The Candle of life.</span>6. Such wonderful effects have natural things being fitted unto their
    Hours and Constellations, as also when they are used to prove such
    effects as the nature of the things doth produce of it self, though
    in a weaker degree. To raise <i>Tempests</i> Magicians burn the Liver of a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>
    Camælion on the house top. To cause <i>strange sights</i> they hang the
    Gall of a Ox over their Beds; to bring <i>Apparitions</i> and <i>Spirits</i>,
    they make a strange fume of a Mans Gall, and the Eyes of a black
    Cat; <i>Which</i>, <i>Agrippa</i> saith, <i>he hath often made experience of</i>.
    There is also a strange Magical Candle described amongst <i>Chymical</i>
    Authors, which being lighted, foretells the death of the party to whom
    it belongs. The manner thereof is thus; <i>They take a good quantity
    of the venal blood luke-warm as it came out of the vein, which being
    Chymically prepared with Spirit of Wine and other Ingredients, is at
    last made up into a Candle, which being once kindled, never goes out
    till the death of the party whose blood it is composed of; for when he
    is sick, or in danger, it burns dim and troubled; and when he is dead,
    it is quite extinguished</i>; of which Composition a Learned man hath
    wrote an intire Tractate, <i>De Biolychnio</i>, or, <i>The Lamp of Life</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">That Characters are compacts.</span>7. But to proceed to the nature of <i>Characters</i>, <i>Sigils</i>, and other
    <i>Ceremonies</i>, we find that not only such as pretend to command over all
    sorts of Spirits; but also they that do make Compacts, and have sold
    themselves unto him, do make use of such; which instance is sufficient
    to prove what a wise man hath asserted, that although Evil Spirits
    have so blinded Mens Eyes, as to make them believe they are defended
    by such Ceremonies, and that these Characters are as Munitions against
    the Devils malignancy; Yet these very <i>Characters</i>, <i>Sigils</i>, <i>Lamins</i>,
    &amp;c., are <i>Compacts</i> themselves, which the Devils did at first cunningly
    disguise with strange Repetitions in uncouth Language.</p>

  <p>8. So that we have grounds to believe, that none is able absolutely
    without <i>Compact</i> to call up any <i>Spirit</i>. But that whosoever hath
    pretended to be famous in/<span class="snp"><b>70.</b></span> the Art of Magick or Conjuration, hath (to
    himself unknown) <i>compacted</i> with and <i>worshipped the Devil</i>, under
    strange <i>Repetitions</i> and mystical <i>Characters</i>, which to him seemed to
    have effects quite contrary to what they really had.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The force of Words and Characters.</span>9. Neither is this to be admired, that without the Knowledge or Consent
    of the Magician, a <i>Contract</i> is made with <i>Evil Spirits</i>; when we
    consider the magical strength of <i>Words</i> and <i>Characters</i>, which of
    themselves can cure Diseases, pull down, infect, save, destroy, charm
    and inchant without the Parties assistance, either in knowledge of the
    Cause, or in belief of the Consequence or Effect.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The vanity of Conjuration.</span>10. But on the contrary, I could instance a multitude of Examples of
    such as have spent much time in <i>Conjurations</i> to no purpose, still
    attempting by Exorcisms and Defensive Prayers to conjure a Spirit,
    or cause Personal Appearances, with severe Imprecations and powerful
    Charges, and yet notwithstanding have never attain’d their purpose, nor
    at any time heard, or seen any Beeing, which may be called <i>Spectre</i>,
    or <i>Apparition</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span></p>

  <p><span class="sni">By Similitude.</span>11. Which is nothing wonderful, if we minde the <i>sympathy</i> of things
    in Nature, how each desires its <i>like</i>, and hunteth after it as the
    Loadstone draws Iron; the male coveteth the female; the evil after the
    evil, and the good after the good; which is seen in wicked Men and
    their Association, in Birds and Beasts of prey; while on the contrary,
    the Lamb delights not in the Lyon, nor the Sheep in the society of the
    Wolf; neither doth the nature which is totally depraved and estranged
    from God, care to be forced or drawn compulsively by another contrary
    nature, <i>viz.</i> innocent, just, and harmless.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Exorcising, or casting out.</span>
    12. Neither doth it consist with natural reason, That <i>Evil Spirits</i>
    should affect the society of those that are their Enemies, who make use
    of the dreadful and holy Names of God in Conjurations to call them up;
    whereas they are rather antidotes against
    Apparations,*<span class="sni">[* <i>sic</i>]</span> as may be
    seen in various Examples of holy Men, who by Prayers and Exorcisms have
    banished <i>Evil Spirits</i> in all Ages, which is also further evident, in
    that the very form of <i>Dispossessing</i> and <i>Exorcising</i> is made up of
    divers Prayers and Defensive Blessings against the obnoxious influences
    of <i>Infernal Spirits</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Like desires its like.</span>13. Therefore though I would be far from describing an undenyable
    course of Conjuring Spirits, or of causing Apparitions: Yet this I must
    assert conclusively from what is before alledged, That if any thing
    would be called or wrought upon, it must be with something which is of
    its own nature, as a bait to catch or tempt it; for in catching Birds,
    Beasts, or Fishes, such esculents as are properly for these Animals,
    are made use of to allure them, neither can mankinde command them by
    any threats to come into his custody.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Nothing is compelled by contraries.</span>14. How much less is mankind able to compel the <i>Infernal Spirits</i>, the
    very least of which Kingdom, is able, if let loose, to exterminate a
    thousand lives, and utterly over-turn poor mortals and their doings,
    as various by-past accidents can evince: But whosoever hath compacted
    with them for body, soul, and works, such they are at unity with, and
    unto such they appear for the advancement of their Kingdom in the
    destruction of others; for they are grafted into them and incorporated
    into their very heart and soul, which unavoidably becomes their wages
    when the body falls away.</p>

  <p>15. Yet many wayes there be by <i>Images</i>, <i>Telesms</i>, and <i>Amulets</i>,
    which have little or no dependance upon Conjuration, or the strength
    thereof, being rather effectual from sympathetical Causes, as many
    natural conclusions prove. And <i>Paracelsus</i> speaks of a way by the
    Image of any Bird or Beast to destroy that Animal, though at a
    distance; so by hair, fat, blood, excrements, excrescences, <i>&amp;c.</i> of
    any Animal or Vegetable, the ruin or cure of that thing may be effected.</p>

  <p>16. Which is seen in the Armary Unguent, and the Sympathetical
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>
    Powder. In the instance of divers Histories, of such as used Waxen
    Images, composed in divers postures, and under certain Constellations,
    whereby several have been tormented and macerated even unto death; and
    according to the punishment or torment which the Magician intends to
    afflict, accordingly do they dispose the/<span class="snp"><b>71.</b></span> hour of the Composition, and
    the posture or semblance of the Image.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Of Images of Wax, and what is wrought by them.</span>17. For if a malitious minded Witch intends to consume and pine away
    the Life or Estate of any miserable Man or Woman, she makes his Image
    of Wax in such an ominous aspect as may conduce to her design, making
    several magical Characters upon the sides of the head, describing
    the Character of the hour or Planetary time upon the breast of the
    Image; the name of the party on his forehead; the intended effect to
    be wrought upon him upon his back. When they cause aches, pains, and
    violent pangs in the sinews and the flesh, they stick thorns and pins
    in divers places of their arms, breasts, and legs. When they cast them
    into Feavers and Consumptions, they spend an hour in every day to
    warm and turn the Image before a doleful and lingring fire, composed
    of divers exotick Gums, and magical Ingredients of sweet Odours, and
    strange Roots of shrubs, efficient for their purpose.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Further concerning Images.</span>18. Wonderful are the various postures and pranks which Magicians play
    with Images; neither will I mention the most perfect and prevalent part
    of the practice of Images, and the powerful operations thereof, least
    the evil minded should work abominations therewith upon the Persons or
    Possessions of their neighbours.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Of Images provoking Love.</span>19. According to the nature of what they would effect they frame
    their Images; if by Images they would provoke two parties to love,
    or be enamoured on one another, they frame their Images naked, with
    Astrological Observations and Imbraces of those that are Venereal; to
    provoke unto enmity they place malignant Characters and Aspects, and
    the Images in a fighting posture.</p>

  <p>20. If their intentions be for good, all their Characters are engraven
    upon the foreparts of the body. But if they would afflict the party
    with Consumption, or with death, they thrust Needles through the
    hearts, and engrave their Characters upon their Posteriors, or upon
    their shoulders, using all their Conjurations retrograde, and repeating
    every Charm opposite to the former.</p>

  <p>21. Thousands of strange and uncouth Charms might be here described,
    according to the exact form wherein Tradition hath left them; But I
    have only insisted upon the description of the natures in General; And
    as by <i>Images</i> and <i>Telesms</i>, the <i>Europeans</i> have effected admirable
    things: so the <i>Tartars</i> have a wonderful
    ways*<span class="sni">[* <i>sic</i>]</span> of producing the
    like effects, by <span class="sni">Forms of Charms in <i>Tartary</i>.</span><i>Botles</i>,
    <i>Sheep-skins</i>, <i>Rods</i>, <i>Basins</i>,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span><i>Letters</i>,
    or <i>Missives</i>, unto certain Spirits, and many otherwayes unheard of in
    <i>Europe</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The tying of the Point.</span>22. As for the <i>Tying of the Point</i>, which is a strong impediment in
    Conjugal Rites, to restrain the acts of secresie betwixt two marryed
    persons; This knot or ligament is become so notorious both in the
    practice and effect throughout <i>France</i>, <i>Italy</i>, and <i>Spain</i>, as also
    in all the <i>Eastern</i> Countries, that the Laws of several Nations have
    prohibited the performance thereof; neither is it fit to be openly
    described in this place.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Charming by the Sive.</span>23. Other stratagems they have by <i>turning the Sive</i> with a pair
    of Sizzers by <i>voices uttered</i> out of <i>skins</i>, which is in common
    amongst the <i>Turks</i> by <i>Letters</i> wrote unto certain Spirits, which by
    due appointments will have their answers returned. By the<span class="sni">By Bottles, Skins, Letters, Cords, Lots.</span> <i>Turning</i>
    of the <i>Cord</i> with several names wrapped round the same, which with
    certain repetitions will of it self be tyed into several strange knots
    which unty themselves again. Besides the many wayes by <i>Lots</i>, in
    extractings*<span class="sni">[* <i>sic</i>]</span>
    Scrolls, consulting with the Staff and the empty Pot,
    with others tedious to be enumerated.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Transplantation, Ceremonious.†<br />[† Ceremonies]</span>24. The <i>Art of Transplantation</i> is also reckoned amongst <i>Charms</i> with
    the vulgar. And indeed one member thereof, <i>viz.</i> the Transferring of
    Diseases is really Magical, and much in practice amongst Witches; for
    by certain baits given to any domestick Beasts they remove Feavers,
    Agues, and Consumptions from Martial men, or from one to another by
    burying certain Images in their neighbours ground they bring all evil
    fortune to the owner of the ground, yet/<span class="snp"><b>72.</b></span> though they add strange Words
    and Conjurations in the practice, the effects thereof are more from
    Nature then Conjuration.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">And meerly natural.</span>25. For, by the same Cause, those that are profound, can destroy
    diseases, take off Warts, and other Excrescences, kill, cure, purge and
    poyson at a distance from the party, by their hair, fatt, blood, nails,
    excrements, <i>&amp;c.</i> or by any root, or carnuous substance, rubbed upon
    their hands, breasts or leggs, by burying which, they free them from
    Diseases, which experiments take effect according to the <i>Mediums</i> and
    their Consumption under ground.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Magical Instruments:</span>26. And as by natural reason every Magical Charm or Receipt had its
    first institution; In like manner have Magicians disposed the Matter
    and Manner together with the times of their Utensils and Instruments,
    according to the Principles of Nature: As the Hour wherein they compose
    their Garments, must either be in the hour of <i>Luna</i>, or else of
    <i>Saturn</i>, in the Moons increase.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Their matter,</span>27. Their <i>Garments</i> they compose of White Linnen, black Cloth, black
    Cat-skins, Wolves, Bears, or Swines skins. The Linnen because of its
    abstracted Quality for Magick delights not to have any
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span>Utensils that
    are put to common uses. The skins of the aforesaid Animals are by
    reason of the <i>Saturnine</i> and <i>Magical qualities</i> in the particles of
    these beasts: Their sowing thred is of silk, Cats-guts, mans Nerves,
    Asses hairs, Thongs of skins from Men, Cats, Bats, Owls, Moles, and all
    which are enjoyn’d from the like Magical cause.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">Substance,</span>28. Their Needles are made of Hedge-hog prickles, or bones of any of
    the abovesaid Animals: Their <i>Writing-pens</i> are of Owls or Ravens,
    their <i>Ink</i> of Mans blood: Their <i>Oyntments</i> Mans fat, Blood, Usnea,
    Hoggs-grease, Oyl of Whales. Their <i>Characters</i> are ancient <i>Hebrew</i> or
    <i>Samaritan</i>: Their <i>Speech</i> is <i>Hebrew</i> or <i>Latine</i>. Their <i>Paper</i> must
    be of the Membranes of Infants, which they call <i>Virgin-parchment</i>, or
    of the skins of Cats, or Kids. Besides, they compose their <i>Fires</i> of
    sweet Wood, Oyl or Rosin: And their <i>Candles</i> of the Fatt or Marrow
    of Men or Children: Their <i>Vessels</i> are Earthen, their <i>Candlesticks</i>
    with three feet, of dead mens bones: Their <i>Swords</i> are steel, without
    guards, the poynts being reversed. These are their Materials, which
    they do particularly choose from the Magical qualities whereof they are
    composed.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">And Form.</span>29. Neither are the peculiar shapes without a natural cause. Their
    <i>Caps</i> are Oval, or like Pyramids with Lappets on each side, and
    furr within: Their <i>Gowns</i> reach to the ground, being furr’d with
    white Fox-skins, under which they have a Linnen Garment reaching to
    their Knee. Their <i>Girdles</i> are three inches broad, and have many
    Caballistical Names, with Crosses, Trines and Circles inscribed
    thereon. Their <i>Knives</i> are Dagger-fashion: and the <i>Circles</i> by which
    they defend themselves are commonly nine foot in breadth, but the
    <i>Eastern</i> Magicians give but seven. And these are the matter and manner
    of their Preparations, which I thought fit here to insist upon, because
    of their affinity with the <i>Instruments</i> of <i>Charms</i>, for both which a
    natural cause is constantly pretended.</p>

  <p><span class="sni">The Conclusion.</span>30. Thus I have briefly spoken of the Nature of every Spirit <i>good</i>
    or <i>evil</i>, so farr as <i>safety</i> or <i>convenience</i> would permit; adding
    also this last Discourse of <i>Charms</i> and <i>Conjurations</i>, in their
    <i>speculative part</i>, forbearing to describe the <i>Forms themselves</i>,
    because many of them are not only <i>facil</i>, but also of <i>mighty power</i>
    when they are seasonably applyed: So that to describe distinctly, by
    what means Magicians <i>kill</i>, <i>cure</i>, or <i>conquer</i>, were to strengthen
    the hands of the Envious against their Neighbours Lives and Fortunes.
    And therefore the Readers must rest contented with what is here related
    of the <i>Nature</i> of <i>Astral</i> or <i>Infernal Spirits</i>.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_99">P. 99</a>. Bodin’s “asseheaded man”. N. Drake, in his <i>Shakespeare and his
    Times</i>, vol. ii, p. 351, suggested that Bottom’s “translation” was
    derived from p. 315 in Scot, where a receipt for such transformations
    is given. This may in part have been in Shakespeare’s memory, as may
    the commonly received belief that magicians could do such things.
    He may, too, have remembered another tale, told at p. 533, of Pope
    Benedict IX having been condemned after death to walk the earth (I
    presume at night, after his purgatorial day) in a bear’s skin, with
    an ass’s head <i>in such sort as he lived</i>. But I incline to think that
    these after-statements only caused him to remember the more this first,
    full, and remarkable M. Mal-Bodin-Cyprus tale; and more especially this
    passage, for in iv, i, 30, Bottom declares—“Methinks I have a great
    desire to a bottle of hay: good hay, sweet hay hath no fellow.” So
    acute and ready an observer may have the more remembered the epithet
    “asseheaded” because, as most readers must observe, Scot uses this
    word, though the sailor in the tale is an ass from his snout and ears
    down to the end of his tail and the tips of his hoofs.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_542">P. 542</a>. His “white spirits”. Because in the 1623 folio <i>Macbeth</i> we
    have in iv, 1, <i>Musicke and a Song. Blacke Spirits, &amp;c.</i>, and because
    in Middleton’s <i>Witch</i> the words are given at length, it has been
    held that Middleton was either Shakespeare’s coadjutor, or his after
    interpolator, that these lines were his, and were first used in his
    <i>Witch</i>. But, according to most of Malone’s arguments—for one certainly
    is not sound—the <i>Witch</i> was some years later than <i>Macbeth</i>, as is
    also likely from Middleton’s age. And that it was later is in especial
    shown by a hitherto unnoticed passage in ii, 1:</p>

    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i12">“Some knights’ wives in town</div>
        <div class="i0">Will have great hope upon his reformation,” etc.</div>
      </div>
    </div>

  <p class="noindent">For it is clear that this must have been written when the price and
    quality of knighthood had much come down, and its commonness increased
    beyond what it was in 1605. Secondly, it is an assumption, and a most
    unlikely one, that the <i>Macbeth</i> MS. intimation of the song was due to
    the players’ knowledge of it through the <i>Witch</i>. It presupposes that
    the supernumeraries who played the witches’ parts were the same in
    both plays. Also that the writers of the MS. knew that these would be
    the same, and would certainly remember the words: for a playhouse copy
    is either for the use of the prompter, or a text whence the players’
    parts can be extracted. Moreover, the <i>Witch</i>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span> had been, as the author
    himself tells us, “an ignorantly ill-fated labour”, in other words, a
    failure.</p>

  <p>But in reference to the supposed right of Middleton to these lines, we
    now find, in 1584, when Middleton was a boy, that the first of the two
    lines—or, if one chooses, the first two of the four, the words being in
    each half phrase inverted, possibly to vary the too great sing-song of
    the sentence—was copied by Scot as part of a known series of rhyming
    lines. Shakespeare, who wrote later, has the “Black spirits”, etc.;
    Middleton, in his <i>Witch</i>, where we find passages taken verbatim and
    almost verbatim from Scot, has these and the other rhymes given by Scot
    very slightly altered in i, 2, and the “Black spirits”, etc., with
    “Mingle, mingle”, and some of the other rhymes in v, 2. Hence they are
    neither Shakespeare’s nor Middleton’s. Whose then are they? Scot gives
    them as from W. W.’s booklet on the Witches at St. Osees, Essex. But
    certainly the lines, nor any of them, are not in that booklet. These
    things, however, are there. Ursula Kempe’s little boy deposes, and she
    herself, on promise from the Justice, Brian Darcie, Esq., of favour
    being shown her—which promise, by the way, both in her case and that of
    others, was carried out by their being hanged—that she had two he- and
    two she-spirits, the shes being Tyffen, in the shape of a white lamb,
    and Pigine, black like a toad; the hes, Tittie, like a little grey cat,
    and Jacke, black like a cat. Nor are these merely thus mentioned by
    each, but the old woman specifies their doings through three or four
    of the earlier pages (A 3, v—A 8). Mother Bennet’s spirits were two,
    Suckin, like a black dog, and Lyerd, redde like a Lyon (B 3, etc., B
    7). Besides these, but less prominently brought forward, were these.
    Mother Hunt had two little things like horses, one white and one black,
    kept in a pot amongst black and white wool (A 5, v and 6). Ales Hunt
    had also two spirits, one white and one black, like little colts, and
    named Jacke and Robbin (C 3). Marg. Sammon had a Tom and a Robyn, but
    these were like toads. H. Sellys, aged nine, deposes that his mother
    had two imps, one Herculus sothe hons [<i>sic</i>] or Jacke, black, and a
    he, who, in the night, and in the likeness of his sister, pulled his
    younger brother’s leg and otherwise hurt him so that he cried out; the
    second, Mercurie, a she and white (D v). Ales Baxter says that the
    cow while being milked was viciously unruly, and that something like
    a white cat struck at her heart, so that she became so weak that she
    could not stand, and being found leaning against a style, was carried
    home in a chair (D 4, v). Ales Mansfield had given her by Margaret
    Grevell (elsewhere Gravell)—for these imps seem to have been given away
    without will of their own, like brute beasts, and being hungry were
    fed on milk, beer, bread, oats, hay, straw, and especially a sup of
    blood sucked from the body—two he- and two she-spirits, named Robin,
    Jack, William, and Puppet, alias Mamet, like black cats (D 6). Mother
    Eustace also had three imps, like white, gray, and black cats. Annis
    Dowsing, aged seven, base daughter of Annis Herd, tells B. Darcie that
    her mother had six Avices or Blackbirds, black speckled with white or
    all black. Also six imps like cows, but “as big as rattes”, one of
    which, black and white, and named Crowe, had been
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span> given to her, while
    Donne [? Dun], another, was red and white (G. 4. v). I have, perhaps,
    overlengthened this tale through wishing to show that these imps,
    besides being hungry, generally took a white or black, and sometimes a
    red or grey, colour, and because these notings from this unique book
    and authentic record might be otherwise acceptable. So much do the
    names and the notice of the colours of the imps strike a reader, that
    Bishop Hutchinson, in his Historical Essay concerning Witchcraft, 1718,
    says, p. 29, “An account of them was written by Brian Darcie, with the
    Names and Colours of their spirits.” But here an end after the remarks.
    First, that the chief witnesses, and leaders up to these confessions,
    were their own children of from 6¾ to 9 years of age. Secondly, that
    these confessions were, as plainly as possible, first made by some and
    then followed by others through promises of favour, promises lyingly
    carried out to condemnation and death. Thirdly, that, as shown by such
    instances as “[she] desired to speake alone with me, the said Bryan
    Darcey, whereupon I went into my garden”, etc., and by the frequent
    use of “before mee”—the initials W. W. were either fictitious, or not
    improbably those of his clerk, and that the real author was Brian
    Darcie, Esq., Justice of the Peace, who desired to gain favour from
    his kinsman, Lord Darcie, to whom the book was dedicated, or possibly,
    through him and it, the notice of her Majesty, as a clever, zealous,
    and trustworthy seeker-out of these old-new things.</p>

  <p>It need hardly be added that ballading was then a profession, and that
    its professors seized upon anything of interest,—an atrocious murder,
    the last words of the murderer (spoken or not), unusual floods or
    storms, the effects of lightning, the cruise of an adventurous vessel,
    shipwrecks, the story of a strange fish “in forme of a woman from the
    wast upward”, that appeared “forty thousand fathom above water [or
    otherwise], and sang as followeth”. How then should the condemnation of
    some sixteen old women for horrible crimes escape being “balletted”?
    It was new, rare, came home to all, and was in more senses than one
    deadly. The very rhymes in Scot prove it, for they could not be Scot’s
    own words, and they have the very rhythm, or rather lilt, of a ballad.
    On looking calmly, therefore, at the evidence, I am convinced that
    neither Shakespeare nor Middleton could have been the one who tacked
    together these rhymes between 1582 and 1584, but that Shakespeare did
    here, as he sometimes did, and notably in Ophelia’s madness, quote such
    lines as “Black spirits and white”, etc., because the words suited his
    scene of devilish enchantment, and gave it reality; while Middleton, in
    a Magical Tragi-Comedy, gave, with very slight variation, the whole of
    the words quoted by Scot.</p>

  <p>I trust my reader will not merely excuse it when it regards Shakespeare
    and <i>Macbeth</i>, if I go a little out of my present road and add the
    few words following. As it has been held that Middleton wrote “Black
    spirits”, etc., so it has been supposed that the lines on the “Touching
    for the Evil” were interpolated by Middleton or some other, because
    negative evidence seemed to show that James did not take upon himself
    this custom till a date much later than 1605. Lately, however, Prof.
    S. R. Gardiner has discovered that James
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span> “touched” and was almost
    compelled to “touch” as early as 1603. Its efficacy had been believed
    in, and was set forth in books; so that the very assumption of this
    prerogative proved its efficacy, and thus proved his rightful heirship
    to the English crown,—a proof, I suspect, not lost sight of by the
    astute counsellors who counselled its adoption, nor by James himself.
    And I think that he must be blind who cannot see how this, added to the
    other evidence set forth in the play, and to the true, though somewhat,
    and of purpose, indirectly exposed intent of <i>Macbeth</i>, proved both
    James’s heirship and set forth the certain overthrow of all such
    devilishly contrived plots,—such as, to name but three, the attempt at
    the Carse of Gowrie; the plot in which Raleigh was, or was supposed
    to be, concerned; and lastly, the gunpowder plot—as would alter the
    predestinate decree of Heaven, that James I and VI should be King of
    Great Britain. Unless, too, I am much mistaken, the fears of James were
    the direct or indirect instigators of Shakespeare’s play, and the cause
    of that autograph letter to the poet, for which no shadow of a reason
    can otherwise be assigned.</p>

  <p>For convenience’ sake I here include some notings illustrative of
    either Shakespeare’s indebtedness to Scot, or of those beliefs and
    forms of expression which led both to write as they did.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_10">P. 10</a>. “They can pull down the moon.” This belief, derived from classic
    times, is authority for Prospero’s “A witch ... so strong That could
    control the moon” (v, i). So also ii, 1, 174.</p>

  <p>——— “Corne in the blade.” There is frequent reference to this in Scot,
    as here and at pp. <i>A</i> iiii, <i>v</i>, 49, 58, 63, 219, 221, 482, and
    elsewhere. But as Staunton saw, this is the nearest to <i>Macbeth’s</i>
    “though bladed corn be lodged” (iv, 1). Also, though this happens more
    or less in several of the instances, yet especially here, the context
    agrees with the thoughts and context-words of <i>Macbeth</i>.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_33">P. 33</a>. “Anthropophagi and Canibals.” Associated synonymes probably
    suggested to both by the same heading in p. 1100 of Seb. Münster’s
    <i>Cosmography</i> (Basil, 1550).</p>

  <p><a href="#p_42">P. 42</a>. “Never faile to danse.” An authority for the dancing of
    <i>Macbeth’s</i> witches, and a probable authority for the dancing of the
    latter with broomsticks headed with brooms in their hands.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_54">P. 54</a>. The “Monarcho” of <i>L. L. Lost</i> appears from this to have been a
    madman.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_64">P. 64</a>. “Rime either man or beast to death.” An extension of the
    Shakespearean and general belief that they rhymed (Irish) rats to
    death. <i>As You Like It</i>, iii, 2.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_77">P. 77</a>. “No power to occupy.” Proof that this last word was used in the
    sense of to use or be busied with, from which general use it came to be
    employed as common slang for a disreputable and vile using.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_170">P. 170</a>. “Chattering of pies and haggisters.” A haggister is the Kentish
    term for a pie, or magpie. The passage explains why Duncan (i, 5) is
    not welcomed by these, but by the ill-omened raven that is hoarse with
    croaking his approach. W. Perkins on <i>Witchcraft</i>, works, ed. 1613,
    says: “When a raven stands on a high place and looks a particular way
    and cries, a corse comes thence soon.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span></p>

  <p><a href="#p_187">P. 187</a>. “A thousand for one that fell out contrary.” We would more
    correctly write—“A thousand that fell out contrary for one that fell
    out rightly or correctly.” But this and others are examples of what we
    would call a more than loose way of expressing oneself, though then
    it was allowable, for Scot was an educated and intelligent man, who
    wrote well. “Each putter out of five for one”, <i>Tempest</i>, iii, 2, is
    an almost exactly similar instance. The putting out of five for one is
    considered as one action, and is—<i>pace</i> Dyce—the receiving, as Malone
    says, at the rate of five for one, the putter out being he who puts out
    in the hope of receiving five for one.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_212">P. 212</a>. “The blind man ... in killing the crow.” Green’s <i>Defence of
      Cony-Catching</i>, p. 70, ed. Grosart, gives this proverbial saying—“as
    blinde men shoote the crowe”. <i>Hamlet</i>, 4to., 1603, has the variant—“as
    the blinde man catcheth the hare”.</p>

  <p>“A green silk curtain.” These words, also in Middleton’s <i>Witch</i>, i,
    2, illustrate the custom which led Sir Toby (<i>Tw. N.</i>, i, 4) to say,
    “Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before ’em? Are they like to
    take dust like Mistress Moll’s picture?” And these last words, by the
    way, prove that this same Moll had, for her own purposes, the portrait
    exposed in some painter’s shop, or painters’ shops, or rather free
    fronts, without a curtain.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_269">P. 269</a>. “If a soule wander ... by night.” Proof that the wandering of
    Hamlet’s father’s ghost was strictly in accordance with traditional
    folk-lore. So, p. 462, we have, “How common an opinion ... reveale
    their estate”; and p. 535, “They affirme ... soules of saints”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_347">P. 347</a>. “Bodkin.” The text and margin show that this was used for a
    small dagger, and the woodcut on the next page that it was sometimes at
    least a rod-like and pointed weapon. Being thus shaped it was small,
    more easily carried at the waist, and less readily broken either by a
    bone or by an adversary’s stroke.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_382">P. 382</a>. “<i>Beliall.</i>” This goes to show that he was “the other devil”
    whose name had escaped Macbeth’s porter. Its being less common in men’s
    and preachers’ mouths would account for his non-remembrance.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_416">P. 416</a>. “<i>Lignum aloes.</i>” Against any argument drawn from the italic
    use of <i>Hews</i> in Son. 20, and its not being italicised in its first
    use in the same line, nor anywhere else in Shakespeare, the fact that
    <i>Alloes</i> appears in <i>The Lover’s Complaint</i>, as well as do other words
    in the Sonnets, has been brought forward. But without entering in
    detail into the question, I would note that three substantives, all
    names of vegetables, are here mentioned, and that this alone is placed
    in italics. So, in the Appendix II, 1665, pp. 67-8, we have a number of
    aromatics named, but this only, and only on its second occurrence, is
    with <i>Sperma Ceti</i> placed in italics—the reason, I presume, being, that
    as a medicine, a more strange and less-known name to the commonalty,
    and a Latin one, it was treated as a quoted proper name.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_497">P. 497</a>. “He burned his booke.” A precedent, as was Acts ix, 19, for
    Prospero’s “I’ll drown my book”, when he left his island.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span></p>

  <p><a href="#p_498">P. 498</a>. “Bicause they want.” One example, among many, from Elizabethan
    and present authors, and from provincial use, where want = “be”, or
    “are without”. This in part explains <i>Macbeth</i>, iii, 6, where Lennox
    exclaims, “Who cannot want the thought?” The true difficulty lies in
    the use of the negative “cannot”. But while a more correct style would
    have “can”, the more colloquial and hasty use of the former was, I
    think, permissible, just as was the use of the double negative where it
    was not meant to be, as it usually was, emphatic. Moreover, it gives
    here a double or ambiguous sense, such as, I think, Lennox wanted to
    express.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_504">P. 504</a>. “One instant or pricke of time.” Illustrates somewhat
    differently than I think is usually explained, “the prick of noon”. <i>R.
    and Jul.</i>, and other places.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_516">P. 516</a>. “Diverse shapes and forms.” Shakespeare follows this ruling
    when he makes Ariel and his co-spirits assume different shapes, though
    some modern critics find fault because he being on some occasions
    invisible, these changes are, in their opinion, unnecessary. But
    the appearance of these spirits, sometimes as invisible, sometimes
    as visible, sometimes in spirit form, sometimes as Juno or Ceres,
    sometimes as harpies, is not only in accordance with the then beliefs
    as to airy spirits, but to me, and to those who have seen their
    representatives, it is more pleasant to see them in forms appropriate
    to their office, besides bringing their spiritual existence and power
    more vividly before us. Critics here, as well as elsewhere, too often
    insist on considering Shakespeare as the author of books to be read,
    and not of plays to be acted and seen.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_518">P. 518</a>. “This devil Beelzebub.” So seems to have thought <i>Macbeth’s</i>
    porter.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_520">P. 520</a>. “The cruell angel.” Here in Prov. 17 [11] we have one of the
    principles on which <i>Macbeth</i> was planned and executed.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_533">P. 533</a>. “Soules appeare oftenest by night;... never to the whole
    multitude, also may be seene of some[,] and of some other in that
    presence not seene at all.” Here is proof of the folk-lore correctness
    of the ghost appearing only when Marcellus and Bernardo were alone
    on watch, and of his being afterwards invisible to the Queen in her
    own chamber, though visible to Hamlet while there in obedience to her
    summons.</p>

  <p class="mt5">Appendix II, <a href="#p_46">P. 46</a>, par. 8. “<i>But it is rarely known.</i>” Though this
    is after Shakespeare’s time, the belief, in all probability, was in
    existence in his day, and shows how the writer of the first and unknown
    <i>Hamlet</i> followed in <i>Hamlet’s</i> ghost the beliefs of his day.</p>

  <p>“<i>Feature.</i>” An example of its being used for the make of a man,
    and not merely of the features of his countenance, to which it is
    now appropriated; but till I can find—and as yet I have found none,
    though I have looked out for it—an example of feature used for things
    inanimate, I cannot accept the interpretation of song or sonnet in
    Touchstone’s <i>As You Like It</i>, iii, 3, 3. Feature here, as any shape
    or proportions, is perfectly intelligible. Did it refer to verse we
    should expect “features”. From no man, as Touchstone is depicted by
    Shakespeare, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span>
    could we less expect verse-making, and all his reference
    to it in this passage may readily have arisen from his reference to his
    new situation as like that of the <i>honest</i> poet Ovid among the Goths.
    Had he been poetical and given her verses, he could not have explained
    to Aubrey that he, being a poet, only feigned to love her.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_198">P. 198</a>. “<i>Primus secundus.</i>” This goes far to show—proves, I think—that
    the Clown’s “Primo, secundo, tertio is a good play” (<i>Tw. N.</i>, v, 1),
    a passage on which no commentator known to me has touched, thinking it
    a merely jocular remark, is, in fact, taken from a well-known “play”
    or game. What the game was is unknown to me, but children still use
    various numerals, provincial or otherwise, mingled with rhyme, to
    settle anything, as, for instance, who shall hide in the game of hide
    and seek.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_471">P. 471</a>. “Biggins.” Shows, as does 2 <i>Hy. IV</i>, iv, 5, 27, that, if not
    nightcaps, they meant, among other significations, caps worn at night
    and in bed, and that “homely” was not a generic epithet.</p>

  <p>Introd. Rainolde Scot’s Will “bank or pond”. I note this because it
    may possibly help to some future interpretation of Iris’s words in the
    <i>Tempest</i>, iv, 1, 64, “The banks with pioned ... brims.”</p>

  <p><a href="#p_117">P. 117</a>. “<i>Marmaritin</i>”, etc. In i, 2, he copies these names, altering
    only their order for the sake of the verse, and probably for the same
    reason omitting “Mevais”.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="i20">“I could give thee</div>
      <div class="i0">Chirocinata, adincantida,</div>

      <div class="i0">Which I could sort to villainous barren ends.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><a href="#p_124">P. 124</a>. “Needles wherwith dead bodies are sowne or sockt into their
    sheetes.” [Noted amidst charms procuring love and hate.] In i, 2,
    following the marmaritin passage, we find—</p>

  <div class="poetry">

      <div class="i20">“More I could instance</div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This is the more noteworthy, as to sock a corpse seems to have been a
    Kentish phrase. “A privy gristle”, etc., as given by Middleton, was, I
    presume, one of the other things which, “for reverence of the reader”,
    Scot omits, though whence the former got it I know not.</p>

  <p>——— Among other “toies which procure love” are, “a little fish called
    Remora”. In the same scene of the <i>Witch</i>, we find—</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="i0">“<i>Hæc.</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou com’st for a love charm now</div>

  </div>

  <p>——— Scot also gives “the bone of a greene frog, the flesh thereof being
    consumed with pismers or ants”. And Middleton’s Hecate adds—</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="i0">“The bones of a green frog too, wondrous precious,</div>
      <div class="i1">The flesh consum’d by pismires.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>——— “The haire growing on the nethermost part of a woolves taile ... the
    braine of a cat.” In ii, 2, Almachildes, speaking of love charms, says:
    “The whorsom old hellcat would have given me the brain of a cat ... and
    a little bone in the hithermost part of a wolf’s tail.” In the words
    “bone” and “hithermost” he may have erred in memory, or there may in
    the latter word have been a copyist’s error.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_153">P. 153</a>. Hecate, i, 2, enumerates “Urchins, Elves, Hags, [fairies]

    mentioned by Scot, and in the same order.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_184">P. 184</a>. Scot, from J. B. Porta. Neap., gives a receipt to be used by
    witches when they would transport themselves through the air. “℞ The
    fat of yoong children and seethe it [etc., etc.].... They put there,
    into Eleoselinum, Aconitum, Frondes populeas and Soote.... Another
    receipt.... ℞, Sium, acarum vulgare, pentaphyllon, the bloud of a
    flittermouse, solanum somniferum, &amp; oleum.”</p>

    2, just quoted] they seeme to be carried through the air, to feasting,
    singing, dansing, kissing, colling, and other acts of venerie, with
    such youthes as they love and desire most.” In i, 2, just after the

  <p><a href="#p_186">P. 186</a>. “frier Bartholomæus” [Spinæus] saith that ... “the witches
    before they annoint themselves do heare in the night time a great noise
    [= band or troop] of minstrels, which flie over them, with the ladie
    of the fairies, and ... to their journie.” In iii, 1, Firestone says
    ... “Hark, hark, mother, they are over the steeple already, flying over
    your head with a noise of musicians.”</p>

  <p><a href="#p_222">P. 222</a>. “It is constantlie affirmed in <i>M. Mal.</i> that <i>Stafus</i> ...

    could all when they list, invisiblie transferre the third part of their

    tempests, and flouds, with thunder and lightning.” Bodin also, bk. ii,

    witches. Compare i, 2, <i>ad init.</i> for Hoppo and Stadlin, while further

  <p><a href="#p_244">P. 244</a>. “<i>A ab hur hus.</i>” A charm against the toothache. Hence it is
    most probable, especially if the ! of “Puckle!” be in the original,
    that Hecate, after reaching that name, is interrupted by a sudden spasm
    of toothache, which she would exorcise by this “<i>A ab hur hus</i>”. The
    sudden pause, the contortions of her haggard visage, and the grotesque
    movements of the 117-year-old hag would greatly add to the comedy of
    the scene.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_542">P. 542</a>. When this mortal witch Hecate—not the Queen of Hell and of
    Witchdom, as was the Hecate of antiquity and of Shakespeare, and
    others in the middle ages, for, says one of the after writers given
    in the later editions of M. Mal., “Hecate artem magicam doceret”—uses
    in i, 2, the very rhymes spoken of under this page in the Shakespeare
    writings, some [ands] and [&amp;c., his] being omitted, and “devil-lambe”
    being changed to “devil-ram”. In v, 2, she again mentions “Titty and
    Tiffin, Leaid and Robin”, and this time “Pucky”, for the rhyme’s sake.
    Hellwin and Prickle are—as shown by her other mention of them (see
    note, p. 153), as well as her mention of them elsewhere—mere copyists’
    or printers’ errors for Hellwain and Puckle.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p><a href="#p_222">P. 222</a>. One would here add the quotation from Ovid’s <i>Metam.</i> made
    by Hecate, the first line running in Scott, Middleton, Corn. Agrippa
    (<i>Occult Phil.</i>, l. 1, c. 72), and in Bodin, Dæmono, l. 2, c. 2: “Cum
    volui ... ipsis mirantibus” instead of “Quorum ope cum ... mirantibus”;
    but that from the accidental dropping of the line “Vivaque saxa”, etc.,
    in Bodin, and its omission also in Middleton, it would seem, as Dyce
    remarks, that Middleton took it from Bodin. In concluding, I would
    state that most, but not all, of these references are taken from Dyce’s
    <i>Middleton</i>.</p>

    <h2 class="xlarge">EXTRACTS FROM WIER.</h2>
  </div>

  <hr class="r4" />
  <h3 class="large">I.</h3>

  <p>Besides those noted by Scot in the margins, I have gathered the
    following from Wier, though very possibly some may have been
    overlooked. By far the greater number occur in the 12th Book of Scot;
    that is, they consist chiefly of various charms and illustrative tales.</p>

  <p>I would not be understood, however, as thinking that Scot in all these
    cases copied from Wier, any more than I would assert that some later
    Astronomer Royal has quoted from Herschel, without mentioning him, the
    fact “that the earth revolves around the sun”. The reference in both
    to the <i>Homerica medicatio</i> from Ferrerius (in Scot, Ferrarius) is a
    notable one in point, and two other instances will be found in Notes
    on the Text. I quite agree, also, with Prof. W. T. Gairdner when he
    says, <i>Insanity</i>, p. 61: “Nothing, however, is more evident than that
    Scot, however indebted to Wier (and both of them probably to Cornelius
    Agrippa...), was far in advance of either in the clearness of his views
    and the unwavering steadiness of his leanings to the side of humanity
    and justice.”</p>

  <p>N.B.—“&amp;c.” for the words following in the page has been omitted, as
    unnecessary.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_7">P. 7</a>. The reader may compare the first, and the first part of par. 2
    of ch. 3 with Wier, <i>De Lamiis</i>, c. 5, “Quocirca eam”, etc., and judge
    whether the remembrance of this latter did not suggest Scot’s words.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_53">P. 53</a>. “One <i>Bessus</i>.” From Plutarch. Also given by Wier; but I have
    lost the reference.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_111">P. 111</a>. “<i>Chasaph.</i>” Scot seems to have remembered Wier ii, 1, § 2, but
    not to have copied him. Wier gives Exod. 22, 18. οὐ περιβιὠσατε; Scot,
    οὔκ ἐπιζεώσετε, a variant I know not whence obtained, not being in the
    Oxford 1821 ed. of the Sept.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_123">P. 123</a>. “<i>Eusebius</i> ... poison.” Wier iii, 38, § 2 and 4. Both call
    Lucilia Lucilla. Scot omits § 3 regarding Alphonso of Arragon.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_126">P. 126</a>. “This word <i>Ob</i> ... <i>Ventriloqui</i>.” Wier ii, 1, § 12.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_177">P. 177</a>. “Onen ... to the interpretation of dreames.” Wier ii, 1, § 8,
    “aliquando observara somnia.”</p>

  <p><a href="#p_183">P. 183</a>. “The art ... in digging for monie [... omit]. There must ...
    treasure awaie.” Wier v, 11, § 1. Scot adds “bona” after “videre”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_184">P. 184</a>. “℞ The fat ... impudentlie affirmed them” [close of ch.]. Wier
    iii, 17, § 2, 3. But from the first and last words of Scot’s chapter,
    he, as well as Wier, took these things from J. B. Porta, though he may
    have been led by Wier to consult Porta.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">554</span></p>

  <p><a href="#p_230">P. 230</a>. “<i>Balsamus.</i>” Scot’s words at the beginning of the chapter
    were suggested by Wier v, 9, § 4, though he has added some descriptive
    particulars; then these words are given by both, Wier adding that three
    Agnus Dei’s were sent by Pope Urban.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_231">P. 231</a>. “<i>A wastcote of proofe.</i>” Wier v, 8, § 2. Scot’s “little
    virgine girl” is a “junioribus notæ castitatis puelles”, his “hat” is
    “galea”.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>Gaspar.</i>” These verses, with a longer proem, are in Wier v, 8 § 1.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_240">P. 240</a>. “<i>Homerica medicatio.</i>” Wier v, 19, § 1. See note in its place.
    Wier quotes at length from Ferrarius, § 2, 3, and 4, gives his name
    rightly, and rightly reads in the present passage <i>verbis</i>, and not as
    Scot, <i>verbi</i>.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>Nos habitat.</i>” Wier v, 19, § 3, from Ferrarius.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_242">P. 242</a>. “For the falling evil ... no more.” Wier v, 8, § 2; but he
    finishes the charm with “In nomine [etc.]. Amen.”</p>

  <p><a href="#p_243">P. 243</a>. “<i>Ananizapta</i>”, v, 9, § 6. Wier gives <i>Ananisapta</i>, has “quæ”
    instead of “dum”, l. 1, and adds “contra febres a quodam nebulone ...
    offerantur”.</p>

  <p>——— “Write upon a piece of bread” [for the bite of a mad dog]. This Scot
    gives from v, 8, § 6. But Wier has “... Khiriori essera ... fede”.
    Afterwards, “Vel hoc scriptum in papiro, aut pane, homini sive cani
    in os inseritur”. In the <i>O rex</i>, etc., there are crosses after each
    person of the Trinity, and a “prax” after Gaspar, while “I max” is
    “ymax”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_244">P. 244</a>. “Against the toothache.” “<i>Galbes, etc.... persanate.</i>” These
    two charms, omitting the intervening one, are in Wier v, 8, § 6, adding
    to the <i>persanate</i> one, “hoc scriptum appenditur”. The second, “At
    saccaring”, etc., is given v, 4, § 2.</p>

  <p>——— “Let a virgine”, v, 8, § 3. Wier preceding this with the words, “Ita
    antiquitas credebat, verbascum cum sua radice tusum, vino aspersum,
    folioque involutum, &amp; in cinere calefactum, strumisque impositum, eas
    abigere, si hoc fecisset virgo jejuna jejuno, &amp; manu tangens supino
    dixisset.”</p>

  <p><a href="#p_246">P. 246</a>. “A gentlewoman”, v, 18, § 1. But the charm is a versification,
    probably by Scot himself, of a German prose sentence, and it was given
    and the story told “a viro Ecclesiastico, non infimi nominis Theologo”.
    Scot evidently thought that this description of the perpetrator of so
    indecorous a jest might better be omitted, even though he were a German.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>To open locks</i>.... Take a peece ... <i>Amen</i>”, v, 11, § 2; but
    “hinder” is anteriore. The essential part of the words just marked as
    omitted is in v, 11, § 3.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>A charme to drive ... house.</i>” This and the marginal note are in
    v, 14, § 4. But Wier places “vel” between each of the Bible sentences,
    therefore Scot’s “this sentence” should have been “any of these
    sentences”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_247">P. 247</a>. “<i>Another for the same</i>”, v, 14, § 2, beginning “Item”. Scot
    has shortened his “fiftlie”, and omitted that the beggar must pray with
    all attention. Also in his haste he omits that the conjuror gave doses
    of rhubarb and other herbs twice daily.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span></p>

  <p><a href="#p_247">P. 247</a>. “The sicke man”, v, 23, § 6. Wier gives the words of the
    “gospell” that is to be carried about his neck—“Hoc genus dæmonii non
    ejicitur, nisi jejunio &amp; oratione”—taken, though apparently by memory
    only, from Matt. 17, 20, Vulg. The names in Scot’s margin are in Wier,
    Gualterio, Bernhardo.</p>

  <p><a href="#Page_200">Pp. 247-8</a>. “This office or conjuration.” The paragraph is from v, 22, §
    6, with a slight condensation of the first words.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_248">P. 248</a>. “<i>A charme for the bots</i>”, v, 4, § 8. Scot only omitting the
    “sanctus” before “Job”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_249">P. 249</a>. “There are also”, v, 4, § 7. Wier commences—“Vidi, haud ita
    pridem apud magnæ authoritatis virum nobilem, librum conscriptum
    execrabilem, flammis dignissimum, plenum exorcismis, frequenti crucis
    consignatione, &amp; ex sancta Scriptura formulis in nomine Patris [etc.]
    finitis, contra equorum non modo morbos quoslibet,” etc. But he has not
    “as it ... Rome.”</p>

  <p>——— “Item, the Duke of Alba”, v, 4, § 5. “Equo item Vice-regis in
    sacello suum fuisse locum ubi celebraretur Missa. Continebat &amp; dux
    exercitus vexillum in manu, quamdiu sollennibus ritibus idipsum
    uti campanæ solent, baptizaretur. Ornabat &amp; hunc actum effigies D.
    Virginis Mariæ cum filiolo in eodem volans, &amp; duæ complicatæ manus ad
    stipulantium morem.”</p>

  <p>——— “That wine”, v, 4, § 9. Scot omitting after eager, “eo anno”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_252">P. 252</a>. “<i>Mahomets</i> pigeon”, i, 19, § 3, 4. Scot omitting all notice of
    the apostate confederate Sergius, of the trained bull, and of the words
    before rex esto, viz., “Quicunque tauro jugum imponat”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_253">P. 253</a>, “At Memphis in Aegypt”, i, 19, § 1, faithfully yet freely.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_254">P. 254</a>. “I conjure thee O serpent ... unto the Jewes”, v, 4, § 10.
    But Wier has no “otherwise”, nor any signs of the whole being two
    conjurations. After Jewes he has, “te vermem a me discedere oportet,
    velut a Judæis discessit Deus noster”. His magical words are “Eli
    lass eiter, ... eitter, ... eitter”. Scot’s second “I conjure” is
    “exorciso”, and for fear of error, Wier’s “Divam Mariam” becomes “S.
    Mary”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_257">P. 257</a>. “A charme ... with images of wax ... afterwards in another.” P.
    258, l. 1, is in Wier v, 11, § 6, 7, 8, except that “And if they were
    inserted”, etc., is Scot’s. The charm words in Wier are “Alif cafiel
    zaza ...” adding “leviatan leutatace”. Scot also gives a sentence which
    perplexed me till I turned to Wier, “&amp; ferrum, quo homo necatus fuit,
    traditur alteri imagini, [of wax] ut alterius necandi simulachri caput
    transigat”. Also, after “angell must be mentioned”, Wier adds, “Non
    absimile monstrum fingitur, ut quis tibi in omnibus obsequatur”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_259">P. 259</a>. “<i>Imparibus</i> ... breake a bone of him”, v, 12, § 1. I doubt,
    however, Scot’s dividing “<i>Jesus autem</i>” [etc.] from “You shall not”
    [etc.] by the last “otherwise”, for Wier does not, and in § 3 tells of
    one who silently submitted to all tortures, and on whom was found—“sub
    scruffiam inter crines quandam parvam schedulam”, containing “✠ Jesus
    autem transiens ✠ per mediam illorum ✠ os non comminueris ex eo ✠”.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">556</span></p>

  <p><a href="#p_260">P. 260</a>. “<i>Charmes to ... theefe</i>”, to end of second paragraph, except
    from “even as plainlie” to “confutation hereof”, will be found in v, 5,
    § 1, 2. But there are some additions in Wier (it may be from Cardan)
    which I leave to the student reader to look up.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_261">P. 261</a>. “<i>Another waie ... theefe</i>”, v, 5, § 6. Wier adds, “ex
    sacrifici libro clam a me subtracta”. Scot’s “sea side” is “fluentem
    aquam”, the “forme of conjuration” is “per Christi passionem, mortem, &amp;
    resurrectionem (quam propter impie curiosus celo)”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_262">P. 262</a>. “<i>To put out the theeves eie</i>”, v, 5, § 7. “A coopers hammar,
    or addes”, is “malleo cypressimo”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_263">P. 263</a>. “<i>Saint Adelberts cursse</i>” to “<i>in morte sumus</i>”, Wier, v, 6,
    § 1. Scot, evidently by accident, omits after <i>made orphanes</i>: “sint
    maledicti in civitate”, and by a press or other error the “<i>&amp; odio
      habeantur</i>”, etc., becomes “or hated of all men living”, a change
    slightly injuring the sense. I know not whether it be due to the more
    frequent repetition of <i>maledicti</i> in the Latin, but this curse reads
    to me more horrible in the original than when translated. I would also
    note that here, as sometimes elsewhere, Wier speaks more, and more
    strongly, against some of these things than does Scot.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_266">P. 266</a>. “They naile a wolves head”, v, 20, § 3.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_267">P. 267</a>. “<i>Terque</i>”, given in Wier, v, 21, § 1.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>Adveniat</i>”, v, 21, § 6.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>Baccare</i>”, v, 21, § 4.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_269">P. 269</a>. “<i>To spoile a theefe</i>”, v, 5, § 8. But the strange words are in
    Wier, “Droch, myrroch esenaroth”, and in the next set of unintelligible
    words “<i>Eson</i> ✠” is “✠ eson” and “<i>age</i>” is “ege”. He also explains
    more clearly, I think, that all these conjuring terms are to be thrice
    repeated.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_270">P. 270</a>. “Say three severall times”, v, 4, § 6, the final Amen and some
    ✠s being omitted.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>Charmes against a quotidian</i>”, v, 8, § 7. With these differences,
    the three pieces, “the jejunus”, should “easdem tribus diebus edat”.
    Instead of Scot’s “Otherwises” we have “Si minus successerit, in
    pane missali scribitur: O febrem omni laude colendam: in altero, ...
    in tertio ... Si nec hic modus juverit, denuo in pane dicto toties
    pingatur: ... quem diebus, ut supra, mane absumat.” Whence it would
    seem that three massecakes were in each instance to be used, and not
    one divided into three, a thought probably suggested by the three
    pieces of apple.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>For ... agues intermittent.</i>” The whole paragraph is in v, 8, § 7.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_271">P. 271</a>. “<i>S. Barnard</i>”, Wier i, 16, § 6.</p>

  <p>——— “Take three consecrated ... Trinitie”, v, 4, § 2, “Recipe tres panes
    Missales”, etc.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_272">P. 272</a>. “In the yeere.” This paragraph is, with a little freeness of
    translation and a slight addition, both in the unimportant parts, from
    v, 4, § 5.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_273">P. 273</a>. “Take a cup of cold water.” This paragraph is from v, 4, § 3.
    Scot’s English verses are thus in Wier: “✠ In sanguine Adæ orta est
    mors: ✠ in sanguine Christi redempta est mors: ✠ in eodem
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">557</span> sanguine
    Christi præcipio tibi ✠ ô sanguis, ut fluxum tuum cohibeas”. Wier
    then goes to “Aliud: De latere ejus” [etc.], and continues: “Item
    (Otherwise) ex quacunque corporis parte profluentum sanguinem cohibere
    nituntur his verbis: Christus natus est in Bethlehem” [etc.]; and then,
    without any Aliud, Item, or other sign that it is not a continuation
    of the same charm, “Tene innominatum digitum in vulnere, &amp; fac cum eo”
    [etc.]; Scot’s “five wounds” being “sanctorum quinque vulnerum”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_273">P. 273</a>. “There was a jollie fellowe” to “This dooth Joh: Wierus”, etc.,
    is from v, 15, § 1. Wier begins, “Ad insignis malitiæ chirurgum”, but
    Scot’s “jollie” seems to have been taken from his drinking habits,
    which in Wier are spoken of in a more pronounced manner.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_275">P. 275</a>. “This surgion”, v, 15, § 2. But Scot’s “ague” is in Wier
    “febrem”, and it is added that not long afterwards the patient died,
    in his (Wier’s) opinion of an empyema. I marvel that Scot omitted this
    last.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_276">P. 276</a>. “Otherwise: Jesus Christ”, v, 15, § 3. Scot omits the ✠ after
    the first Christ.</p>

  <p>——— “Another such cousening”, v, 15, § 4.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_282">P. 282</a>. “At Easter”, v, 40, § 4. Note, in the margin I have placed [?
    or] for the “on” of text. The “?” is unnecessary, for in Wier it is
    “infra cornua vel aures”.</p>

  <p>——— “Otherwise <i>Jacobus</i>”, v, 40, § 3.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_294">P. 294</a>. “The corral”, v, 21, § 5. But Scot refers to Avicenna, though
    Wier does not; nor do the names of the precious stones spoken of,
    nor the remarks upon them, coincide with those in Wier at the above
    reference.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_303">P. 303</a>. “Also that a woman”, Wier vi, 9, § 1, gives this, but his words
    differ so much, that it can only be that both happened to notice this
    common superstition.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_421">P. 421</a>. “<i>Exorciso te creaturam aquæ ... apostatis</i>”, v, 21, § 16,
    giving “apostaticis”. But Scot’s giving the whole form, both of this
    and of the exorcism of salt, and his italics, show that he took it
    from, I suppose, the <i>Missale</i> or other R. C. book of devotions, though
    Wier may have given the idea.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_433">P. 433</a>. “<i>Jacobus de Chusa</i>”, i, 13, § 1, to middle of 6. Scot’s first
    paragraph is different; in the rest he sometimes amplifies, sometimes
    condenses, sometimes omits Wier’s words, and Wier says that he gives J.
    de Chusa’s <i>verba fideliter</i>. The first prayer at its close is in Scot
    shortened.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_445">P. 445</a>. “I conjure thee.” This, like the “... creaturam salis”, 421,
    is given in Latin by Wier, v, 21, § 27, down to “adjuratus”. Both the
    Latin and English in Scot are the same, except a slight difference
    after “judicare”, arising from Scot, in this second instance, giving
    the sense rather than the <i>verba ipsissima</i>.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_507">P. 507</a>. “<i>Rabbi Abraham</i> ... collected.” Translated from i, 6, § 7.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_518">P. 518</a>. “For <i>Beelzebub ... manium</i>”, i, 5, § 3.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_519">519</a>. Nisroch (5); Tartac [not Tarcat] (4); Beelphegor (1); Adramalech
    (2); Chamos (6); Dagon (8); Astarte (7); Melchom (7); are in Wier i,
    5, § 3, with other gods, and in the order here marked. The
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">558</span> wording
    after each is also Wier’s, as is the error “Ozee 9, 11” for 9, 10. Both
    also make the same mistake as to the duality of Astarte and Astaroth,
    because in 1 Kings ii, 5, she is called Astarthe in the Vulg., whence
    Wier took his names, and Scot followed him, and not his English Bible.
    Both mention that the word means “riches, &amp;c.”, and that it was a city
    of Og; though both, curiously enough, here forget the observation they
    had made elsewhere as to other cities, that it was dedicated to, and
    therefore called after, the deity. Scot omits also Wier’s supposition
    that both Beelzebub and Beelphegor were Priapus.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_520">P. 520</a>. This chapter, from the “heading” to the end, is derived from
    i, 21, § 1, to § 25, but is much abbreviated; some titles also are
    omitted; but except for a slight change in the positions of both
    <i>Diabolus</i>, and his last names, “owle”, etc., Scot follows the order of
    Wier.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_521">P. 521</a>. “<i>Lares</i> ... cities”, i, 6, § 6, except that Wier has “cuam
    agere” for both “trouble”—an odd word here—and “set to oversee”.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>Virunculi terrei</i> ... drawe water.” Follows generally, though not
    quite literally, i, 22, § 5.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>Dii geniales</i> ... birth”, i, 6, § 6, shortened.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_522">P. 522</a>. “<i>Tetrici</i> ... <i>Subterranei</i>; <i>Cobali</i>; <i>Guteli</i> or <i>Trulli</i>
    (the etymology being Scot’s); <i>Virunculi</i> [<i>montani</i>, Wier]; <i>Dæmones
    montani</i>.” These being in the same order, are adopted from Wier i, 22,
    § 8-11, but much shortened. “<i>Hudgin</i>” immediately follows as “Hutkin”,
    § 12.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>Hudgin</i> ... ware a cap”, i, 22, § 12. Here it is said—“pileo caput
    opertus unde &amp; vulgo Pileatum eum appellabant rurales, hoc est, ein
    Hedeckin, lingua Saxonica.”</p>

  <p>——— “<i>Familiares Dæmones</i> ... Simon Samareus ... to come”, etc.—but of
    course omitting <i>Feats</i> and <i>Dr. Burcot</i>—are from i, 22, § 7. Also
    “Albæ mulieres and Albæ Sibyllæ”, though shortened. The “did much
    harm” is from Wier. “<i>Deumus</i>, <i>Agnan</i>, <i>Grigii</i>, <i>Charoibes</i>” and
    “<i>Hovioulsira</i>” follow in order, § 23-26. See note on <i>Deumus</i>.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_523">P. 523</a>. “Raise thunder ... <i>Elicius</i>”, i, 6, § 6, but in the
    enumeration of the “<i>Dii selecti</i>” Wier and Ennius are not followed,
    but Varro.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_525">P. 525</a>. “As namelie of beasts ... <i>Latus</i>”, is, I believe, from Strabo
    originally, but by Scot was taken, I think, from Wier i, 6, § 2.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_533">P. 533</a>. “Pope Benedict the eight and ninth”, i, 16, § 3 and 4. But
    Scot’s “seen a hundred years after”, whereas Wier only has “postea”,
    seems to show that the former had referred to Platina.</p>

    SCOT ON THE NAMES, ETC., OF DEVILS FROM WIER,</span><br />
    <span class="small">BUT PROBABLY THROUGH T. R., MENTIONED <a href="#Page_327">P. <i>393</i></a>.</span></h3>

  <p><a href="#p_377">P. 377</a>, l. 13. “Seventie and nine.” The list given by Scot is 68 +
    1 accidentally omitted + Beelzebub not mentioned + the 4 kings of
    the N., S., E. and West = 74. Wier himself gives no total, but the
    discrepancy in Scot may perhaps have arisen from his copying 79 from T.
    R., from whom, as an intermediary, and not directly from Wier, or from
    some other, I think, from facts presently to be mentioned, it will be
    rendered probable that he copied.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_378">P. 378</a>. “<i>Marbas.</i>” After this name Scot omits from Wier’s
    list—“Purflas, alibi invenitur Busas, magnus Princeps &amp; Dux est,
    cujus mansio circa turrim Babylonis, &amp; videtur in eo flamma foris,
    caput autem assimilatur magno nycto-coraci. Autor est et promotor
    discordiarum, bellorum, rixarum et mendaciorum. Omnibus in locis non
    intromittatur. Ad quæsita respondet abunde. Sub sunt huic legiones
    vingenti sex, partim ex ordine Throni, partim Angelorum.” The edition
    of Wier that I have used, I may here remark, is chiefly that of 1660,
    but where any doubt arose, that of 1583. But from whence did Wier
    obtain these things? Under <i>Belial</i> (I give Scot’s English) he says:
    “Without doubt (I must confesse) I learned this of my master Salomon;
    but he told me not why he gathered them together, and shut them up
    so. But I beleeve it was for the pride of this <i>Beliall</i>.” Secondly,
    under <i>Gaap</i>, he says: “I may not bewraie how and declare the meanes
    to conteine him, bicause it is abhomination [nefandam], and for that
    I have learned nothing from Salomon of his dignitie and office”. And
    Wier has in his margin “Scelerati necromantici verba sunt”. Thirdly,
    Wier, in his address before his Pseudomonarchia, says: “hanc ... ex
    Acharonticorum Vasallorum archivo subtractam”; and at the close of
    this address: “Inscribitur vero a maleferiato hoc hominum genere
    Officium spirituum, vel, Liber officiorum spirituum, seu Liber dictus
    Empto.[rium] Salomonis, de principibus &amp; regibus dæmoniorum, qui cogi
    possunt divina vertute &amp; humana. At mihi nuncupabitur Pseudomonarchia
    Dæmonum.”</p>

  <p><a href="#p_377">Pp. 377-93</a>. Scot, in these second, third, and fourth chapters, follows
    Wier, but for these reasons did not, I think, directly translate him:</p>

  <p>1. As stated under <i>Marbas</i>, <a href="#p_378">p. 378</a>, <i>Purflas</i> is omitted.</p>

  <p>2. Three sentences are retained in their original Latin, as though the
    translator could not understand them. (<i>a</i>) Under <i>Barbatos</i>, “... in
    signo sagittarii sylvestris”, he probably knowing Sagittarius, but not
    sure as to what sign or who sagittarius sylvestris might be. (<i>b</i>)
    Under <i>Leraie</i>, “... quos optimos objicit tribus diebus”. Wier here
    places “optimos” as the third word, but the sense to me and my friends
    is an unsolved puzzle. (<i>c</i>) Under <i>Oze</i>, “... Duratque id regnum
    ad horam” (but Wier omits the “ad”), “And this sovereignty lasts an
    hour [and no longer], differing in this from ordinary monomania.”
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">560</span>3.
    Under <i>Bileth</i> Scot and Wier say, “... as for <i>Amaimon</i>”, and Scot
    in the margin has “Vide Amaimon”; yet neither mentions him under a
    heading, nor more than by name, as “Amaymon king of the East”, in chap.
    iv. 4. Under <i>Murmur</i>, Scot ends with “and ruleth thirtie legions”,
    but Wier omits this, as do both in the cases of <i>Oze</i>, <i>Vine</i>, and
    <i>Saleos</i>. 5. There are differences and slips of translation which Scot
    could not, I think, have made. (<i>a</i>) Scot invariably, in the rest of
    his works, speaks of “the order of virtutes”, but in this chapter,
    where it is used five times under <i>Agares</i>, <i>Barbatos</i>, <i>Purson</i>,
    and <i>Belial</i>, and ch. iv, <a href="#p_395">p. 395</a>, it is “vertues”. (<i>b</i>) <i>Barbatos</i>
    is said to come “with foure kings, which bring companies and great
    troopes”. But Wier has “cum quatuor regibus tubas ferentibus”. From
    this it is clear that the translator read “tubas” as “tribus”. (<i>c</i>)
    “Ugly viper” is the translation of “viperæ species deterrima”. (<i>d</i>)
    “He giveth answers of things present, past, and to come”, is in
    Wier “Dat perfecte responsa vera de ... futuris &amp; abstrusis”; Scot
    omitting both “perfecte” and “abstrusis”. See under <i>Botis</i> for both
    (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>). (<i>e</i>) “<i>Bune</i> Muta loquitur voce”, rendered in Scot,
    “he speaketh with a divine voice”. The translator apparently looked
    out for “mutus” in a dictionary, such as Th. Cooper’s, where in Old
    English he found “dumme”, and read it—as I at first sight did, and with
    great astonishment, though I confess my thoughts were running on the
    puzzle—“divine”. (<i>f</i>) Under <i>Bileth</i>, “... before whome go trumpets
    and all kind of melodious musicke”, Scot has, “or if he have not the
    chaine of spirits [the book called <i>Vinculum Spirituum</i>], certeinelie
    he will never feare nor regard him after”, but Wier has, “... sciet
    haud dubie exorcista, malignos spiritus postea eum non verituros, et
    semper viliorem habituros”. (<i>g</i>) “Sitri ... willinglie deteineth
    secrets of women”, is in Wier, “secreta libenter detegit fæminarum”.
    Here there are in the English two gross blunders, as is evident on
    reading the rest of the Latin text. “Ludificansque”, also, is not
    “mocking”, but “toying with them”, “ut se luxuriose nudent”. (<i>h</i>)
    Under <i>Paimon</i>, Wier’s “in Empto.[rium] Salomonis” is “in <i>Circulo
    Salomonis</i>”. “Aquilonem” is “North-west”, though Th. Cooper and
    Holyokes Rider, and, I believe, all dictionaries, only give it and its
    adjectives as North, North-east, and Northern. “Accedant”, also, is
    translated “may be reckoned”, to the complete extinction of the sense.
    (<i>i</i>) <i>Belial</i> is, “eorum qui ex Ordine [Potestatum] ceciderunt”,
    and is translated, “of them which fell being of the orders”. (<i>j</i>)
    “He is found in the forme of an exorcist in the bonds of spirits”,
    is, in more ways than one, a strange and most ambiguous rendering,
    altogether unlike Scot, of “Forma exorcistæ [the form of exorcising
    that is to be used] invenitur in [the book] <i>Vinculo Spirituum</i>”.
    (<i>k</i>) “Si autem se submittere noluerit Vinculum Spirituum legatur, quo
    sapientissimus Salomon”, etc., becomes “If ... let the bond of spirits
    be read, the spirits chaine [apparently an unintentional doubling of
    the previous words], is sent for him wherewith wise Salomon”, etc. I
    might add that twice in the course of this chapter “sapientissimus
    S.” becomes “wise S.”, in “vase vitreo” “in a brazen vessel”, and “in
    puteum grandem” “into a deep lake or hole”, and twice afterwards “lake”
    only. (<i>l</i>) Under <i>Furfur</i>, “fulgura,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">561</span> coruscationes &amp; tonitrua” is
    translated “thunders and lightnings, and blasts”. (<i>m</i>) In <i>Malphas</i>,
    “artifices maximos” is “artificers”. (<i>n</i>) Under <i>Vepar</i>, “Contra
    inimicos exorcistæ per dies tres ... homines inficit” becomes, without
    qualification, “he killeth men in three days”. (<i>o</i>) Under <i>Sydonay</i>,
    “Cum hujus officia exercet exorcista”, instead of “When the exorcist
    would make use of the offices [the incantations for] of this [spirit]”,
    or “When the exorcist would make use of the forms of invocation proper
    to this spirit”, it is translated, “When the conjurer exerciseth this
    office”. The next words, “fit [? sit] fortis”, become “let him be
    abroad”, “foris” having been read instead of “fortis”. “If his cap be
    on his head”, Wier has “si coopertus”, “if he be overwhelmed” [with
    fear, etc.], the translator possibly wishing to express this by “if
    his cap be so far on his head” [through fear as to cover his eyes],
    then, etc. Besides this, there is an ambiguity in Wier which is fully
    followed in the translator. In Wier we have: “si vero coopertus fuerit,
    ut in omnibus detegatur, efficiet: Quod si non fecerit exorcista,
    ab Amaymone in cunctis decipietur:” I can only suppose from the
    punctuation that the “Quod si non”, etc., was intended to refer to his
    not being “fortis”, and (as in Scot) “warie and standing on his feete”.
    (<i>p</i>) Under <i>Gaap</i>, Scot says, “if anie exorcist ... nor see him”;
    Wier has the same, but follows it up with “nisi per artem”. On the
    other hand, Wier has no equivalent for “insensibility”. (<i>r</i>) <i>Shax</i>:
    “... there he speaketh divinely” is “loquitur de divinis rebus”, an
    error Scot could not have made, and which is not made elsewhere in
    this chapter. (<i>s</i>) <i>Procell</i>: “... in the shape of an angell, but
    speaketh darkly of things hidden”, is in Wier, “in specie angelica, sed
    obscura valde: loquitur de occultis”. (<i>t</i>) <i>Raum</i>: “... he stealeth
    wonderfully out of the kings house”; Wier, “mire ex regis domi <i>vel
      alia</i> suffuratur”. (<i>v</i>) In <i>Vine</i>, “lapideos domos” is translated
    “stone walles”. (<i>w</i>) <i>Flauros</i>: Wier says, “vere respondet. Si fuerit
    in triangulo mentitur in cunctis.” Scot follows the same punctuation,
    but had he translated it, he, as a man of intelligence, must have seen
    that the (.) before “Si” should have been struck out and placed after
    “triangulo”, or a “non” inserted after “Si”, for this triangle was
    made specially for the exorcist’s safety and the spirit’s obedience
    and truthful speaking (see under <i>Bileth</i>, <i>Furfur</i> and <i>Shax</i>). It
    must, however, be confessed to be a mark of haste in Scot to have
    admitted such mistakes, even though he only copied, the more so as he
    must have known the <i>Pseudomonarchia</i>. “And deceiveth in other things,
    and beguileth in other business”, is a duplicate translation of “et
    fallit in aliis negotiis”. The omission of “twentie” (viginti) before
    “legions” may be a press error, but the “de divinitate”, translated
    “of divinity”, must be, I think, a translator’s error, for it really
    means “of the Divinity” (see “Purson”). (<i>x</i>) Under <i>Buer</i>, Wier has
    “conspicitur in signo*”; under <i>Decarabia</i>, “venit simili*”; under
    <i>Aym</i>, “altero [capiti, simili] homini duos * habenti.” Clearly the
    book or MS. used by Wier was in these places illegible, or more likely
    the copier had been unable to fill in the wanting word or words, and
    indicated this by a *. But Scot’s authority did not understand it
    on its first occurrence under <i>Buer</i>, and, not mentioning any sign,
    translates it, “is seene in this sign;”! (<i>y</i>) The names of the fiends
    differ also sometimes in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">562</span>
    spelling; omitting such instances as “i”
    for “y”, “c” for “k”, etc., I give Wier first, followed by Scot’s
    form. “Bathym”, alibi “Marthim”—“Bathin”, “Mathin”; “Pursan”—“Purson”;
    “Loray”—“Leraie”, this latter being wrong, because his alias is
    “Oray”. Wier, by the way, also shows that “Leraie” was not pronounced
    “Leraje”, as given in the second edition of Scot. “Ipes”, alias
    “Ayperos”—“Ipos”, “Ayporos”; “Naberus”—“Naberius”, probably the wrong
    form; “Roneve”—“Ronove”; “Forres”—“Foras”; “Marchocias”—“Marchosias”;
    “Chax”—“Shax”; “Pucel”—“Procell”; “Zagam”—“Zagan”; “Volac”—“Valac”;
    “Androalphus”—“Andrealphus”; “Oze”—“Ose”; “Zaleos”—“Saleos”; “Wal,
    1660”, is “Vual (as Scot), 1583”. It will be noticed that “e” is five
    times used for “o”, a MS. copyist’s error.</p>

  <p>I think I had some other proofs in a MS. sheet since lost; but these
    are now overmany to prove that Scot had access to some other copy than
    Wier’s <i>Pseudomonarchia</i>, and made use of it, and that his translator
    was not very conversant with Latin. Wier, it may be added, puts
    “Secretum ... horum” in one line, and without a capital to the “Tu”,
    and gives no explanation of the words in any way, and Scot confirms our
    conclusion from these facts by the marginal, “This was | the work of |
    one T. R.” | etc., and the words “written [&amp;c.] vpō parchment” seem to
    show that this 1570 translation was in MS. (See also General Notings,
    <a href="#p_418">p. 418</a>.)</p>

  <p><a href="#p_379">P. 379</a>. “<i>Eligor.</i>” I do not understand the double titles here and
    elsewhere given, nor why “miles” should here be translated “a knight”,
    while under <i>Zepar</i>, <i>Furcas</i>, <i>Murmur</i>, and <i>Allocer</i> it is “soldier”.
    In chapter iii, p. 393, is given the time when knights (“Milites”,
    Wier) may be bound, but nothing, of course, is said of “soldiers”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_383">P. 383</a>. “Tocz.”, like a contraction, but Wier has “Tocz” without any
    stop.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_384">P. 384</a>. “<i>Astaroth.</i>” Scot, merely copying, is not responsible for her
    being a male. At p. 519 and p. 525, he writing, calls Astarte a “she
    idoll”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_389">P. 389</a>. “<i>Valac</i> ... with angels wings like a boie”, cannot, I think,
    be Scot’s translation of “uti puer alis angeli”.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>Gomory.</i>” Wier says “ducali corona”, but the rest is the same; and
    it must be remembered that a fiend (as in Incubus and Succubus) could
    be of either sex.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_390">P. 390</a>. “<i>Aym</i> ... a light firebrand.” Here (as elsewhere in Scot) we
    find, as was then often done, the past of verbs ending in t or d elided
    the ed, or, rather, coalesced them. Wier has “ingentem facem ardentem”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_391">P. 391</a>. “<i>Flauros</i> ... if he be commanded.” Wier adds “virtute numinis”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_392">P. 392</a>. “<i>Note that a legion.</i>” Wier simply has “Legio 6666”. The rest
    is, in all probability, Scot’s own.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_393">P. 393</a>. “Ch. 3” is “§ 69” of Wier.</p>

  <p>——— “Ch. 4” is “Citatio Prædictorum Spirituum”, and though not marked as
    a new chapter, is one having § 1, § 2, etc.</p>

  <p>——— These are the variations between Wier and Scot in this chapter 4,
    or Citatio, Wier being in Latin, Scot in English. (<i>a</i>) “For
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">563</span> one
    [companion] must always be with you”; “si præsto fuerit”. (<i>b</i>) 394,
    “effect”; Wier adds, “imo tuæ animæ perditione”. (<i>c</i>) “And note”,
    etc., is Scot’s own. (<i>d</i>) The ✠ before “holie trinitie” is in Scot
    only. (<i>e</i>) Scot omits ✠ after “holie crosse”. (<i>f</i>) Wier’s “anathi
    Enathiel” is in Scot “Anathiel”. (<i>g</i>) The “Heli, Messias”, after
    “Gayes” in Scot, are in Wier at the end of the list. (<i>h</i>) Scot’s
    “Tolimi” is Wier’s “Tolima”. (<i>i</i>) [Second list of names.] Scot’s
    “Horta” is Wier’s “hortan”; his “Vege dora”, “vigedora”, Wier’s
    letters, in 1583, being several of them so separated that they could
    easily be read as two words; Scot’s “Ysesy” is “ysyesy”. (<i>j</i>) [Third
    list.] Scot’s “Elhrac” is Wier’s “Elhroc”; “Ebanher”, “eban her”.
    (<i>k</i>) P. 666, Scot’s “Cryon” is “irion”; “Sabboth” is, as before,
    more rightly “sabaoth”. And I may add that while every word in Scot
    is capitalised except “dora”, really the sequel of “Vige”, only “Deus
    Sabaoth”, “Α” and “Ω”, “Rex”, “Joth”, “Aglanabrath”, “El” “Enathiel”,
    “Amazim”, “Elias”, and “Messias” of the first list, none of the second
    list, “Elhroch” the first of the third list, and none of the fourth
    list are capitalised.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_395">P. 395</a>. “As is conteined in the booke called”, etc. This ambiguous
    sentence is better explained by Wier’s “Continua ut in libro * Annuli
    Salomonis continetur”, that is, continue the “etc.” as etc. It may be
    added that the *, the mark of an omission, is omitted in the English.</p>

  <p>——— Scot (<i>i.e.</i>, his authority) wholly omits Wier’s final § 5: “Hæc
    blasphema &amp; execranda hujus mundi fæx &amp; sentina pœnam in magos
    prophanos bene constitutam, pro scelerato mentis ausu jure meretur.”
    Scot, I think, would be unlikely not to translate this, or be incited
    by it to write something similar, but it would be wholly against the
    purport of T. R. Some of the differences entered into, both just
    above and previously, seem to favour the belief that two independent
    copies of the <i>Empto. Salomonis</i> were used, but very many merely show
    carelessness, and possibly no great amount of Latin. The giving of the
    name “✠ Secretum secretorum”, etc., at the same place, viz., just at
    the end of the enumeration, etc., of the principal devils, might seem
    to favour a copying from Wier; but we must remember that the <i>Empto.
      Salomonis</i> from which these leaves are copied may itself, and possibly
    by way of proving its genuineness, have copied these details from an
    earlier, or supposedly earlier, “Secretum secretorum”.</p>

  <p>Wier, i, 7, § 10. “Similiter ex parte postica &amp; uteri collo novit

  <p><a href="#p_2">P. 2</a>. “Ring bells.” Still done in Switzerland, and, I think, elsewhere.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_10">P. 10</a>. “As <i>Merlin</i>.” Cf. p. 72.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_14">P. 14</a>. “That cause ... taken away.” The mediæval Latin saying, “ablata
    causa tollitur effectus”. Repeated p. 319.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_17">P. 17</a>. “W. W. 1582.” [In his preface.] A proof that witches were not
    then burnt in England; but it shows how the question of witchcraft was
    then exercising the people that Ade Davie, the wife of a husbandman,
    pp. 55–7, thought that she was to be burnt. W. W. says also that Mr.
    Justice Darcie, persuading Eliz. Bennett to confess, said: “As thou
    wilt have favour confesse the truth. For so it is, there is a man
    of great learning and knowledge come over lately into our Queenes
    Majestie, which hath advertised her what a companie and numbers of
    Witches be within Englande: whereupon I and other of her Justices have
    received Commission for the apprehending of as many as are within these
    limites, and they which doe confesse the truth of their doeings, they
    shall have much favour: but the other they shall be burnt and hanged”
    (B. 6). She and others that confessed had the favour of being hanged
    like the rest; possibly they had the additional favour of being hanged
    first. The first notice that I have yet come across of burning is that
    of Mother Lakeman at Ipswich, 1645. W. W., in his Dedication, speaks
    of these witches as “rygorously punished. Rygorously, sayd I? Why it
    is too milde and gentle a tearme for such a mercilesse generation. I
    should rather have sayd most cruelly [? civilly] executed: for that
    no punishment can be thought upon, be it never so high a degree of
    tormēt, which may be deemed sufficient for such a divelishe &amp; dānable
    practise”; and again, “the magistrates of forren landes ... burning
    them with fire, whome the common lawe of Englande (with more mercie
    then is to be wished) strangleth with a rope.” The burning was, I
    presume, inflicted under the ecclesiastical law, De hæret. comburendo.</p>

  <p>But burning was not at first universally adopted (a proof that it was
    not imposed by the common law), for at the Assizes at Maidstone, 1652,
    they were hanged, but “Some ... wished rather they might be burnt to
    Ashes: alledging that it was a received opinion amongst many [for in
    some cases it was held as proof against a witch that her mother had
    been burnt for the same crime] that the body of a witch being burnt,
    her blood is prevented thereby from becomming hereditary to the Progeny
    in the same evill, which by hanging is not.”</p>

  <p><a href="#p_19">P. 19</a>. “Excommunicat persons.” Evidence of Scot’s haste, and of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">565</span> his
    trusting to his memory. Wishing to find the Latin for “runnawaie”, I
    looked into M. M. and found: “Nota quod excommunicati, item participes
    &amp; socii criminis, item infames, et criminosi nec servi contra dominos
    admittentur ad agendum, &amp; testificandum in causa fidei quacunque.” It
    will be observed that he remembered “infames” as “infants”, and, as
    there might have been a misprint in his copy, I have consulted all—not
    a short list—in the British Museum. Possibly he was influenced by W.
    W.’s book, which had taken a strong hold on him, if it were not one of
    the causes of his writing, for there, children from 6¾ to 9 years
    (infants in law) were taken as witnesses against their mothers, while
    one woman’s proof was that her infant in arms pointed to the house!</p>

  <p><a href="#p_24">P. 24</a>. “To the God speed.” This, by the context, might be taken as
    meaning that he came to a fortunate issue. But it was, and is, in
    use as given to a person setting forth on a journey, etc. Hence,
    here, and especially at p. 481, it seems to mean that he came at
    the commencement, when one receives or gives this salutation. As is
    recorded in an instance at Windsor, “R. S. probably gave the God speed
    at the assembly, and God’s name so frayed the witches that they fled,
    and so frayed the devil that he was conquered in a hand-to-hand fight.”</p>

  <p>——— “At shrift.” This was laid down by Roman Catholic priests, though
    it was, and is, a rule with them that no confessor can reveal a
    confession, even before a court of law!</p>

  <p><a href="#p_41">P. 41</a>. “But bargained to.” The sense requires “[not] to observe”.
    Probably a slip of the printer, possibly through the “but”, and the
    concurrence of two t’s.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_42">P. 42</a>. “<i>La volta.</i>” A fact strangely overlooked (as is David’s
    dancing) by the damners of dancing.</p>

  <p>——— “Socke the corps.” The same in p. 124 explains that this is sewing
    the body in its winding-sheet or sheets. The phrase is Kentish.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_45">P. 45</a>. “Young maister”, <i>i.e.</i>, their new master, they having just come
    under the devil’s sway.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_48">P. 48</a>. “Of fiftie.” In Scot, as in others, we find uses of “of”
    which are to us strange. Here is a clearer example than usual of its
    synonymity with our “by”. Cf. also p. 76, and Auth. Ver., 1 Cor. xv,
    5-8.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_50">P. 50</a>. “The veines have passage.” For as little, others—as Paracelsus,
    by R. Browning, etc.—have been credited—to the discomfiture of
    Harvey—with the knowledge of the circulation of the blood. Even
    Shakespeare is so credited by some whose knowledge will assert
    positively that the moon is <i>not</i> made of green cheese.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_60">P. 60</a>. “Their not fasting on fridaies.” Scot’s Protestantism here
    went beyond the ordained Protestantism of his age, as did that of B.
    Jonson’s Cob.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_78">P. 78</a>. “Clime up and take it.” Not the nest, but his own belongings.
    A good example of the pronoun not referring to its grammatical
    antecedent, but to the antecedent which was most in the mind of the
    narrator.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">566</span></p>

  <p><a href="#p_80">P. 80</a>. “Away withall” = “Companion with” here, in other places “agree
    with”. An expression that sounds odd to us, but then used practically
    and metaphorically, from the idea of companionship on a journey, when
    companionship was almost or altogether necessary.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_84">P. 84</a>. “The [night]mare.” Most, I suppose—among them I myself—have
    known that these occur at times to a person in a deep sleep. My
    fourth nightmare, a horrible, troubled, and inconsequent dream, so
    far as I can remember, occurred some two years ago; three, at only a
    month or two’s interval between each, occurred years ago, when in a
    snake country. Then one appeared to be on and in my primitive bed, or
    wriggling about my wattle and daub bedroom, the only room I had. I
    thought myself wide-awake, bed, bedroom, and furniture being plainly
    visible, and my thoughts and conclusions were as coherent, and myself
    as self-possessed as at any moment of my life, until a sense of
    unreality came upon me, and by two or more vigorous efforts of both
    mind and body I awoke myself. My experience, and that recorded p. 84,
    will explain various ghostly stories—I do not say all—wherein the
    sufferer asserts positively, and believes, that he was wide-awake.</p>

  <p>——— “As sure as a club.” The derivation and meaning—as sure as is a
    tangible club that can or will strike you—is obvious; but I have heard
    it at the card-table, as though derived from the sureness of the cards
    thus named. An example of a false application arising from the apparent
    sameness of the words, and possibly in the first instance from a
    jocular use of the phrase.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_85">P. 85</a>. “Hampton.” Folk-lore worth recording. I conjecture, but only
    conjecture, that this word was suggested by the hempen or flaxen
    garments laid for his use, its sequent “hamten” being coined to rhyme
    with “stampen”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_87">P. 87</a>. “To her that night.” I have placed “him” in the margin, my own
    conjecture and the reading of the British Museum MS. of parts of Scot.
    But in Fletcher’s <i>M. Thomas</i>, iv, 6, we have the same spell, with some
    slight variations, and ending—</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="i0">“She would not stir from him [St. George] that night”,</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>which more agrees with Shakespeare’s quotation in <i>Lear</i>, iii, 4—St.
    Withold</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="i22">“Bid her alight</div>
      <div class="i6">And her [the nightmare’s] troth plight.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>——— “<i>Viderunt</i>”, etc. Altered, apparently, from Vulgate, which has
    “Videntes ... essent pulchræ”, etc.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>Filios Dei.</i>” Scot here alters “<i>Filii</i>” to the objective, because
    it follows “doo interpret”. He does the same elsewhere, whether it be
    English verb or preposition that precedes. Thus, 422, we have “<i>Vitas
    Patrum</i>”, because it follows “prooved”; 458, “in <i>Speculo exemplorum</i>”;
    and 381, “in <i>Circulo Salomonis</i>; 544, “Spiritum”, because the words
    follow “signifieth”. We find one instance of the same in Nash’s
    <i>Summers Last Will and Test.</i></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">567</span></p>

  <p><a href="#p_90">P. 90</a>. “He accuseth.” Bodin, ii, 6.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_91">P. 91</a>. “A faggot maker.” Bodin, ii, 6.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_94">P. 94</a>. “In the western ilands”, as in the “still vexed Bermoothes”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_95">P. 95</a>. “Saccaring bell” = a sacring bell, the bell rung at the
    elevation of the host, when all true, <i>i.e.</i>, Roman Catholic,
    worshippers fall on their knees.</p>

  <p>——— “A morrowe masse”—a morning mass. All masses, except, I think, on
    Christmas Day and Good Friday, and except in certain churches, where
    the older usage was by prescription allowed, being in Scot’s time, and
    now, celebrated before noon. This rule was made by the Pope in 1550-58.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_99">P. 99</a>. “(His reason onelie reserved).” Not Bodin’s reason, but that of
    the sailor.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_104">P. 104</a>. “<i>Abacuck.</i>” <i>Bel and the Dragon</i>, 36, 37.</p>

  <p>——— “One syllable nor five words.” A curiously sounding phrase; but he
    seems to have used “syllable” as we do, figuratively, meaning, “in the
    same sense”, while the five words are, “not even differing five words
    in the form of expression”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_107">P. 107</a>. “Witch is disposed”, [to plague] being understood.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_110">P. 110</a>. “Make so foolish a bargaine or doo such homage to the devill.”
    We would more exactly say “bargaine [with] or”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_111">P. 111</a>. “Exod. 22” [18]. Did Scot quote from memory? The Sept., φ ου
    ποιησετε [var.] περβιωσετε Ox. ed., nor have I found Scot’s verb as a
    recognised variant.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_113">P. 113</a>. “Eccl.” is twice in the margin put for “Ecclus.”, the
    Apocryphal Book. In p. 145, by, I suppose, a printer’s error, “Eccle.”
    is put for “Ecclus.” Elsewhere, Scot rightly gives “Ecclus.”</p>

  <p><a href="#p_115">P. 115</a>. “Osee 6” [1, 2]. Vulg. has “2. Quia ipse cepit, et sanabit
    nos; percutiet, et curabit nos. 3. Vivificabit nos post duos dies.”
    The “ego”, etc., is only found in Deut. xxxii, 39, where the Vulg. has
    “vivere faciam”.</p>

  <p>——— “If you looke into [what I have written concerning] <i>Habar</i>”, etc.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_119">P. 119</a>. “Besmearing with an ointment.” Such beliefs then current
    justify more than is now supposed the beliefs of Elizabeth and her
    counsellors, and the execution of her would-be murderer.</p>

  <p>——— “Wolves doong.” A bit of folk-lore, which has, I think, sufficient
    <i>vraisemblance</i> as to be worthy of trial, the more so as it is said to
    this day that a young dog shows fear at the smell of a dried piece of
    wolf’s skin.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_126">P. 126</a>. “<i>Eliz. Barton.</i>” See Froude’s <i>Hist.</i>, v, 1. She was of
    Aldington, Kent, and a servant of the father or grandfather of Jane
    Cobbe, Reg. Scot’s first wife.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_127">P. 127</a>. “In his mightie power.” Either the “in” of the line above
    brought about its insertion here, or, more likely, it was used as it is
    “in his name”, though in such a case as this we should say “through” or
    “by”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_132">P. 132</a>. “1572.” This booklet is not known, I believe; nor is it in the
    Stat. Regs.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">568</span></p>

  <p><a href="#p_142">P. 142</a>. “Eccle” [Ecclus, 49, 16, 17].</p>

  <p><a href="#p_145">P. 145</a>. “Covered himself with a net.” An excellent example that this
    phrase meant disguising himself, or trying to conceal himself. It may
    seem odd, that “with a net” should mean this, because one naturally
    thinks of a single fold; but a fisherman conceals his head and body in
    folds of netting.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_146">P. 146</a>. “Finger in a hole.” I presume it is meant that Saul shut
    himself out of all means of knowing what really went on, as much as if
    he had closed up a hole in a shut door or window-shutter, through which
    alone he could see—or have light thrown upon—the subject.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_147">P. 147</a>. “She saith to herself” [but intentionally loud enough for Saul
    to hear].</p>

  <p><a href="#p_150">P. 150</a>. “Right ventriloquie.” This excellent investigation of the Bible
    story might be read with advantage by those who even now hold that
    Samuel really appeared by God’s allowance or command. Such a belief
    involves three impossibilities. First, that God having repeatedly
    declined to answer Saul by lawful means, now by an afterthought changed
    His mind. Secondly, that He who from the time of Moses had so condemned
    witchcraft, that Saul had put it down as far as he could, and that with
    blood, now favoured the action of a witch, and that in so notorious a
    case that it could not but be, as it was, known to all Israel. Thirdly,
    that the Deity must have put a lying spirit into the mouth of a true
    and God-blessed prophet, since the prophecy did not come true in more
    than one important point.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_151">P. 151</a>. “<i>Aias</i> and <i>Sadaias</i>.” Here he rightly distinguishes the two;
    but in 141, and in his list of authors consulted, he gives “Rabbi
    Sedaias Haias”. “Haias Hai”, or “Haja”, was a celebrated Babylonian
    Rabbi, born 969 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>; died 1038. Sedaias or Saadja flourished
    <i>circa</i> 900-40.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_155">P. 155</a>. “Called Pythonissa.” Not by that exact word, either in Sept.,
    or Vulg., or Greek N.T. Vulg., 1 Sam. xxviii, 7, has “mulier pythonem
    habens”; and in Acts xvi, 16, the Greek, the Vulg., and Beza have
    similar wordings.</p>

  <p>——— “Liber pater.” “Liber” is “Bacchus” in Scot himself; but
    Porphyrius—whom Th. Cooper and Calepine follow—says of “Liber pater”:
    “Eundem Solem apud superos: Liberum patrem in terris: Apollinem apud
    inferos.”</p>

  <p><a href="#p_158">P. 158</a>. “Then a cousening queane” = Than [believe that], etc. I
    note: 1. That the (.) before “Then” should probably be a (,), though
    occasionally we have (;) where only (,) is required. 2. That as in this
    book we rarely have “then” for “than”, I conjecture that this mode of
    spelling was not at the time universal, but only commencing.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_159">P. 159</a>. “<i>Nemo scit.</i>” Slightly altered from the question. 1 Cor. ii,
    11, and not the Vulgate words, but apparently more those of Beza.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>Tu solus</i>” [2 Chron. vi, 30]. Vulg. reads, “tu <i>enim</i> solus nosti
    <i>corda filiorum</i> hominem”; it has also “corda”, where David speaks
    to Solomon similarly, 1 Chron. xxviii, 9; but “universas mentium
    cogitationes” follows it.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>Ego Deus</i>” [Jer. xvii, 10]. He omits “<i>probans</i>” before “<i>renes</i>”
    in Vulg.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">569</span></p>

  <p><a href="#p_162">P. 162</a>. “Epotherses.” Rightly, in 163, “Epitherses”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_166">P. 166</a>. “By revolution.” I presume by revolution of the planets
    (and stars, as was then thought), until they came into a certain
    “constellation”, <i>i.e.</i>, position as regards one another. This I gather
    from a previous page.</p>

  <p>——— [Margin] “Zach. 10.” We have here a further example of the loose
    references, common in those days, to the Bible made by both Roman
    Catholics and Protestants. The first clause is in sense is given Zach.
    10 [, 2], and somewhat, Isai. 44 [9, 10]; but the remainder from Ps.
    cxxxv, 16, 17; though “months”, etc., is placed third instead of first,
    while “let them shew” is, I take it, a variant of Isai. xli, 23.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_168">P. 168</a>. “Firmament.” His error in writing “earth” shows his haste, and
    explains in part the wording of his Scripture quotations. Cf. pp. 19,
    174. But see also note, p. 503.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_169">P. 169</a>. “The increase of the moon.” This, his doubtful doubt as to the
    Remora, his belief that the bone in a carp’s head staunched blood, show
    that Scot was not naturally sceptical in matters of knowledge, but that
    he only gave up the beliefs of his day after investigation.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_171">P. 171</a>. “<i>Mahomets</i> dove.” He would express his belief, as Wier does
    more openly, that it (as the eagle) was taught to do its feats.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_173">P. 173</a>. “<i>ηχὼ</i>”. In those days the Η, now confined to the capitals, was
    used, as here in the original, for the small letter <i>η</i>.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_174">P. 174</a>. “Pharaoh the Persian kings.” Other references to the Pharaohs
    in this book show that these curious transpositions were due to haste
    of composition and of revisal both of his MS. and of the printed copy.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_176">P. 176</a>. “Manacies.” Not having met with this form, I presume that it is
    a press error for “menacies”. It is so changed in the second edition.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_180">P. 180</a>. “Faile to dreame by night.” Scot’s general statement may be
    true, but must in some instances be modified. From my youth, for
    many—say at least twenty—years, I tried to remember my dreams for this
    very purpose, and could remember them for a short while very well; but
    never could I find that what I had thought on during the day, or the
    days before, gave even a suggestion to my dreams. Thrice, however,
    of late years, I have been able to trace my dream to something I had
    casually thought of, though not meditated on. This edition of Scot, as
    well as the question of witchcraft, has occupied both my mind and time
    since November, and it is now October, yet not a single dream has had
    reference to anything connected with these subjects. Similarly, family
    matters have both busied me and worried me for some months, and yet
    these matters have never intruded themselves, not even when my dreams,
    and at one time a near approach to nightmare, showed that my digestion
    was out of order. From my own instance, I should rather say that dreams
    most frequently seem to be natural reliefs to the thoughts that I had
    indulged in, or that might have beset me, in my waking hours.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_182">P. 182</a>. “Of physicall dreames.” I suppose he means dreams from physical
    causes.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">570</span></p>

  <p><a href="#p_182">P. 182</a>. “<i>Melancholicall.</i>” Proceeding from “black bile”, which, in the
    opinions of that day, produced melancholy, that form of madness called
    melancholia. I would add that “melancholy” is often used in Scot for
    mad melancholia, and for the supposed humour melancholy or black bile,
    and that, unless this is borne in mind, some of his sentences will be
    misunderstood.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_183">P. 183</a>. “De Profundis.” Ps. cxxix; Vulg. cxxx; Prayer Book. All that
    follow are given consecutively, I think, in the <i>Rit. Rom. Officium
    Defunctorum</i>.</p>

  <p>——— “Pleasant and certain dreams.” Formerly an at least English notion,
    as expressed by the servant-lover of Bombastes:</p>

    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“And morning dreams, they say, come true.”</div>
      </div>

  <p><a href="#p_184">P. 184</a>. “Eleoselinum.” Translated in the second edition as “mountain
    parsley.”</p>

  <p>——— “Sium” in the second edition is “yellow water-cress”.</p>

  <p>——— “Acarum vulgare”, “common acorus”—our “Asarum Europ.”</p>

  <p><a href="#p_185">P. 185</a>. “An errand ... from farre countries.” A similar tale is told—in
    some English work against witchcraft after Scot—of an Italian judge who
    thus tried a supposed witch.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_187">P. 187</a>. “A thousand for one that.” Here the “that” does not, as with
    us, refer to the “one” but to the “thousand” = “he might have cited
    a thousand that fell out contrarie” for one that fell out truly. A
    thousand for one, though four words seem, as it were, to have been
    considered one thought. See Shakespearean noting under this page.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_190">P. 190</a>. “To offer ... to Moloch.” Curious that Scot, knowing that fire
    was accounted holy, should not have seen that this idolatrous rite was
    in its essence a purifying, and possibly an expiatory, one.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_198">P. 198</a>. “<i>Menehas</i>” (example, Deut. xix, 10). Hebr. <b>מנחש</b>. Here he does
    not quite agree with Wier, i, § 9.</p>

  <p>——— “Philosophers table.” Cf. Strutt, <i>s. n.</i> The philosopher’s game,
    played on a “table” or board.</p>

  <p>——— “Sober writer.” Of course, ironical.</p>

  <p>——— “Of each letters.” Either misprint for letter, or rather, perhaps, a
    loose way of saying “of each [set of] letters”, or “of the letters of
    each person’s name or names”.</p>

  <p>——— “Unequal number of vowels.” A bit of folk-lore as yet, I think,
    unnoticed.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_200">P. 200</a>. “Added the Apocrypha.” Council of Trent, 1550, made them of
    equal authority with those which the Church of England defines as
    “Canonical Scriptures”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_202">P. 202</a>. “True loves.” Garden pansies, viola tricolor, L. (Britten and
    H.), four-leaved grass, occasional variations of the three-leaved
    grass, trefoil.</p>

  <p>——— “To our left side.” So far an explanation why horse-shoes, salt,
    etc., are thrown against ill-luck over the left shoulder.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_205">P. 205</a>. “<i>Sero rubens.</i>” P. 169, Scot quotes this in English as
    a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">571</span> lawful divining from natural causes, in fact, as a weatherwise
    observation.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_206">P. 206</a>. “<i>Stella errans.</i>” I presume he means a planet, partly because
    a comet was then thought a portent, differing in origin and nature from
    a star, partly because Cicero uses the plural in the sense of planets.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>Non est.</i>” Not from Vulg. or Beza; probably his own rendering.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_209">P. 209</a>. “Milvus” [Jer. viii, 7]. Sentence as in Vulg., while the Geneva
    version, like our Authorised version, has storke.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_210">P. 210</a>. “Significators”, <i>i.e.</i>, of the planets which have meanings
    according to their positions and co-positions or “constellations”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_212">P. 212</a>. “Sapiens.” A sop of flattery for their client.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_213">P. 213</a>. “Maketh themselves cuckoldes.” = Who by their negligence and
    ignorance cause themselves to be made cuckolds, while pretending to
    know every other person’s future.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_225">P. 225</a>. “Phaers Virgil” [B. 4, <i>ad fin.</i>]. Scot, however, has printed
    each line as two.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_230">P. 230</a>. “Balme”, etc. Note that each longer line has an extra syllable
    at the end.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_232">P. 232</a>. “This is as true a copy.” Apparently a press error for “This
    is a true copy”, as given in the second edition, the printer having,
    inadvertently, almost reduplicated the “is”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_233">P. 233</a>. “✠ Thomas.” His and our “N.” (or sometimes “John”, etc.),
    anyone who may be the invoker.</p>

  <p>——— “A popish periapt.” The distances between these letters are somewhat
    variable, the “ka” and “am” are near enough to be syllables. But I have
    not misspent my time in a search for the true original.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_234">P. 234</a>. “Whistle for a pardon.” An expression still used for other
    things than pardon. Possibly founded on an ironical reference to the
    nautical idea, that when you whistle for a wind you get it, and more of
    it than you want. I have been spoken to for whistling on board ship.
    More probably, however, because whistling denoting want of care and
    thought, as in bench-whistler, one might as well expect a pardon or the
    thing wished for, after merely whistling for it, as expect larks to
    drop into one’s mouth.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_238">P. 238</a>. “Plumme.” I know not whether Scot meant to translate
    “<i>Stircus</i>” literally, but it would be curious to know whether this
    signification was formerly given to “plum”. It could well bear it.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_240">P. 240</a>. “Constant opinion” = firm belief or firm faith.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>Homerica Medicatio.</i>” The physician was “Ferrerius”, alias
    “Auger”, or “Oger Ferrier”—not “Ferrarius”, as given throughout the
    text, in his list of authors, and in his contents—born at Toulouse,
    1513, physician in ordinary to Catherine de Medicis, and afterwards
    returned to his birthplace, where he died in 1588. B. 2, ch. ii, of his
    <i>Vera medendi modus</i> is headed “De Homerica Medicatione”. And here I
    would at once say, that for the discovery of “Ferr<i>e</i>rius” and of the
    following passages, and of the cause of Scot’s curious blunder, the
    reader and myself are indebted to my ever-ready Shakespearean
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">572</span> friend,
    the Rev. W. A. Harrison. “When,” says Ferrier, “patients will not
    yield to ordinary treatment, one must have recourse to another kind,”
    which he describes generally in the margin as “Amuleta”. And first he
    speaks of “appensiones et physicæ alligationes”, then of “Caracteras &amp;
    Carmina”. These, he says, Galen (and Trallianus) at first ridiculed,
    but that Trallian had seen (I believe in his mind’s eye) a tractate
    of Galen’s in which, as the heading of a chapter, or somewhere else,
    were the words “Homericam medicationem; <i>quod Homerus suppressum verbis
    sanguinem, et mysteriis sanatos effectus prodiderit</i>.” The italicised
    passage is that nonsense-sentence of Scot’s at the end of the chapter.
    It could only have arisen from Scot’s haste, but was also due to the
    fact that, as in the British Museum copy of the Lyons edition, 1574,
    the “s” of “verbis” is so faint as to give the not careful reader
    the form “verbi”. But Ferrier, like Scot, attributed such cures to
    imagination or a “fixed fansie”, or “constant opinion”; on which also
    I would refer to Sir H. Holland’s book on the <i>Effect of Imagination
    in Disease</i>. Thus he continues: “Deprehendi itaque curationis hujus
    eventum non a caracteribus non ex carmina permanare. Sed tanta est
    vis animi nostri, ut si quid honesti sibi persuaserit, atque in ea
    persuasione firmiter perseveravit, idipsum quod concepit agat, &amp;
    potenter operetur.... Si neque fidentem, neque diffidentem nihilominus
    vis animi agentis operabatur. Id in dentium doloribus ... aperte videre
    licet. Nam præcantator ita movet non reluctantis ægroti animum, ut
    dolor ... sensim extinguatur.... At si forte æger diffidet, aut plane
    ridiculum existimet remedium ... præcantante vis nulla erit.... Non
    sunt ergo carmina, non sunt caracteres quo talia possunt, sed vis animi
    confidentis, &amp; cum patiente concordis.” Wier v, 19, §1-4, gives the
    Ferrerius quotation, as well as his name, rightly. The staunching of
    blood by words refers to the cure in the <i>Odyssey</i>.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_242">P. 242</a>. “Through sudden feare.” Similar cases are known to physicians
    at the present day, whether through fear or some other sudden emotion.
    A Protestant medical man can well believe <i>some</i> of the tales of
    diseased pilgrims cured at, say, the shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes,
    though no more believing in such miracles than do Roman Catholics when
    Protestant anointers anoint and sometimes cure through the same cause.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_243">P. 243</a>. “Hearbe Alysson.” So called because it cured hydrophobia
    (Pliny). Phil. Holland says, “Some take it to be <i>Asperula</i>, the
    wood-rose”; Holyokes Rider gives “rubia minor, cannabis agrestis”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_244">P. 244</a>. “Scarifie.” Might be done with a gum lancet; but the magical
    tooth might have the advantage in some instances of affecting the
    thoughts, and through them the body, as noted, p. 240.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>Os non.</i>” This, preceded by “✠ Jesus autem transiens ✠ per
    medium illorum ibat ✠”, with a ✠ after “eo”, was, according to Paulus
    Grillandus, who twice witnessed it, a charm producing taciturnity
    and insensibility under torture! Something, either this or something
    else, being repeated by the prisoner in an inaudible voice,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">573</span> a scroll
    containing these words and signs was found “in capite sub scruffia
    scilicet inter crines” (Wier v, 12, § 3).</p>

  <p><a href="#p_244">P. 244</a>. “Throwe.” He might have added, “when you have got it”, before
    which time she would have been released, if not one way yet by another.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_245">P. 245</a>. “Tye.” Is like the “scarifie”; as one generally uses a
    handkerchief.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_248">P. 248</a>. “That thou hereby ... patient as Job.” This is to me one of the
    oddest examples I have seen of the confusion of two or more pronouns
    as to their subject; for though the “thou” a line above clearly refers
    to the worm, this one cannot refer to anything but to the horse; for
    after exorcising the worm in the name of the Trinity, he surely would
    not exhort it to be as “patient as Job” and as “good as St. John”,
    particularly as the exorcism was made that the worm might be expelled
    and die.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_251">P. 251</a>. “Remeeve.” An excellent example of the devices had recourse to
    by Elizabethan versifiers to obtain a rhyme.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_257">P. 257</a>. “Certeine name.” I presume this caution is inserted lest one
    hurt Tom instead of Harry.</p>

  <p>——— “Each image must have in his hand.” For the true reading cf.
    “Extracts from Wier”. Scot must, I think, have trusted too much to his
    memory.</p>

  <p>——— “Domine Dominus”, etc. Pss. 8. 27. 102. 109. Prayer Book numbering.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_264">P. 264</a>. “Bladder.” Clearly a press error for bladders.</p>

  <p>——— “Ribbes and genitals.” Conjoined, apparently, from a remembrance of
    the procreation of Eve, Genesis ii, 21, 22.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_265">P. 265</a>. “Sir <i>John</i> ... pulpit.” As the story was told of “as honest
    a man ... whereof mention was lately made”, he was of the Church of
    England; see under p. 461 for “Sir”. And since, I have found that
    Bishop Hutchinson in his Dedication calls him Sir John Grantham.
    Seemingly we thus have evidence of the dress in the pulpit; but one
    unwilling to be convinced might retort that the very mention of his
    sacerdotal dress is proof that he went into the pulpit exceptionally
    attired, and not to preach, but to perform a quasi-sacerdotal office.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_266">P. 266</a>. “Hundred and eight.” Here, from the “sayers of the charm”, the
    authority is, in all probability, the Vulg. Its 108 is our 109, Scot
    not having in this instance changed the numbering.</p>

  <p>——— “Seachers.” Probably “Sea[r]chers”, as given in the second edition,
    but it may have been a form of seekers, since seche = seek.</p>

  <p>——— “Horsse shoo.” This superstition probably had its origin from
    Stonehenge times and before, since the inner stones there, apparently
    the more sacred portion, and, so far as one can now judge, the
    corresponding part at Avebury, each form a horse-shoe. Sir H. James
    first, I believe, noticed the true shape at Stonehenge, and I
    afterwards independently observed it, both there and then at Avebury,
    and connected it with this horse-shoe superstition in <i>The Antiquary</i>,
    vol. ii, Oct. 1880.</p>

  <p>——— “<i>Alicium.</i>” Have not as yet found this.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">574</span></p>

  <p><a href="#p_267">P. 267</a>. “Herbe betonica.” “Stachys betonica”, Plin., b. 25, c. 8.</p>

  <p>——— “Pullein”, etc. “Verbascum”; “Thapsus”, L., “bullock’s lungwort”
    (Kent). Tusser, like Scot, calls it “Longwort”, a variant of “Lungwort”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_268">P. 268</a>. “Baccar.” “Nardum rusticum”, or, according to Sprengel,
    “Valeriana Celtica”, L.; others “foxglove”, or “asarabacca”.</p>

  <p>——— “Browze”. Gives us the meaning of Bowze = boughs, it being so spelt
    to accord, as was the custom, not only in rhyme but in spelling.</p>

  <p>——— “Vervain.” “Verbena officinalis”, L. (and other verbenas?), used,
    according to Park, “against poison, venom of beasts, and bewitched
    drinks”.</p>

  <p>——— “Palma.” Willows in England were used as the palm on Palm Sunday;
    sometimes the yew; but here I incline to think he means Palma Christi,
    a flat-hand rooted orchis.</p>

  <p>——— “Antirchmon.” I suspect a misprint for “antirrhinum”, calf’s snout,
    snap-dragon, A—. Linn. Pliny, b. 25, c. 8, says it is much esteemed by
    enchanters.</p>

  <p>——— “Lappoint.” Minshen gives “Lapouin”, as the French for lapwing, but
    I have been unable to find this word. Wier v, 21 § 6, says, as Scot,
    “Dicuntur &amp; pennæ upupæ suffitæ, phantasmata fugare”, and the upupa,
    then as now, was taken to be the lapwing, though Th. Cooper says,
    “Wherefore [from his crest as described] it cannot be our lapwing ...
    it is rather ... an Houpe” [hoopoe], which it is likely from the names,
    both being onomatopeiatic. The daughter of the vicar of Oare, near
    Faversham, Kent, Miss K. P. Woolrych, says that an old man, when young,
    heard lappoint as the common name for the still-abounding lapwing.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_269">P. 269</a>. “Cleave an oken branch.” One is tempted to think this bit of
    folk-lore is a reminiscence of Druidical times.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_271">P. 271</a>. “Ps. <i>Exaltabo</i>” Ps. 245, Pr. B. vers.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_273">P. 273</a>. “Nameles finger.” Wier, “innominatum”. From this last, which
    is not so much nameless as “unhappy”, etc., I think the middle finger
    is meant, “digitus impudicus”, “famosus”, “infamis”, under which
    latter epithet, cf. Persius, Sat. ii, for the reason. At 325 he calls
    the middle finger the long, and at 326 the middle, at 329 the longest
    finger.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_275">P. 275</a>. “Made room.” Gave occasion or opportunity.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_284">P. 284</a>. “<i>Finallie.</i>” This is in italics, the mark of a quotation, but
    it is not from the Rhemish Test. of 1582, given as one of the books he
    consulted, nor have I yet found from what Protestant version he took it.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_289">P. 289</a>. “Eccle. 1. &amp; 1.” Probably a press error for 1 &amp; 13, the words
    being a remembrance of the sense of verses 13 and 17. It is not Ecclus.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_294">P. 294</a>. “The corral.” Can we see in this the origin of the almost
    universal coral for children when teething?</p>

  <p>——— “Dinothera.” Cannot find it.</p>

  <p>——— “Aitites.” Properly “Aetites”, a stone said to be found in the
    eagle’s nest. Plin., b. 7, c. 3.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">575</span></p>

  <p><a href="#p_294">P. 294</a>. “Droonke as apes.” An expression readily understood by those
    who have watched the purposeless doings of apes and their throwing
    themselves about.</p>

  <p>——— “Amethysus.” This occurs twice, but I know it not as a variant of
    amethystus. “Corneolus.” Various descriptions are given of this by
    Pliny, Bartholome, Th. Cooper, Minshen, and Holyokes Rider, but I
    presume (as given by Bailey) it is our cornelian.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_295">P. 295</a>. “Smarag.” The emerald. “Mephis.” Unknown to me.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_296">P. 296</a>. “Whereby ... concluded.” It is improbable that this is, as
    elsewhere, concealed irony. Much more probably Scot was not free from a
    belief in the influences of the stars on the formation of these stones,
    just as he believed in the influence of the moon in the sowing of
    seeds, though he did not believe in astrology.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_300">P. 300</a>. “Academicall discourses.” He refers to the disputations held by
    students and candidates at the colleges, as these, of course, naturally
    set forth the opinions of others.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_301">P. 301</a>. “Serpent abandon.” Is this fabulous folk-lore or not?</p>

  <p><a href="#p_302">P. 302</a>. “Celondine, Chelidonius”, cf. p. 293. It appears from
    Dioscorides and Pliny, 25, 8, that the Chel. majus, L., is that spoken
    of.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_303">P. 303</a>. “Reneweth bleeding.” This variant, that it does so either at
    “the presence of a deare friend or mortall enimie”, and not merely at
    that of the murderer, is worthy of note.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_304">P. 304</a>. “Our Princess doth.” This, vouched for by one such as Scot,
    shows the real piety and wisdom of Elizabeth as against the scandals of
    the then times and the beliefs of after times.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_312">P. 312</a>. “Black children.” I put this down either to looseness of
    writing or to that want of discrimination (or colour blindness) which
    led Elizabethans to speak of things as black, etc., which approached
    that colour. “As black as a toad.”</p>

  <p><a href="#p_314">P. 314</a>. “Two manner of todes.” An example of the universal belief that
    all insects, and some eels, serpents, and toads, were not begotten,
    but produced by the action of the sun on inanimate matters, in fact by
    spontaneous generation. Even the generation of man was held to require
    the co-operation of the sun.</p>

  <p>——— “Of the fat of a man ... lice.” He means, I presume, of fat beneath
    the skin of a living person, a belief apparently confirmed by the
    death of persons from lice; for Bartholome, Batman’s alias Trevisa’s
    translation, says, l. 18, c. 88: “Lice and nits gender in the head or
    in the skinne”; and just before, they are engendered “of right corrupt
    air &amp; vapoures that sweate out betweene the skinne and the flesh by
    pores.”</p>

  <p><a href="#p_316">P. 316</a>. “Aqua composita.” Not in Ovid’s sense, but, I presume = spirits
    of wine or rectified wine, etc., though I have not come across the term
    elsewhere. I may add that Aqua was used = Succus.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_319">P. 319</a>. “The cause being taken away.” See note, p. 14.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_333">P. 333</a>. “Nether card.” Scot evidently did not know “the pass”; possibly
    his age did not.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_338">P. 338</a>. “Gaggle of geese.” The then correct term for a flock of geese.
    Cf. <i>The Boke of St. Albans</i>, at the end of “Hawking”.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">576</span></p>

  <p><a href="#p_339">P. 339</a>. “Send them to Pope.” Unable to refer “them” to the “horses” or
    to the “neighbors”, I am forced to believe it an error for “then”.</p>

  <p>——— “Unto the doore.” This (.) should be (,) the “W” marking, as usual,
    the beginning of (the purport of) his speech.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_342">P. 342</a>. “You meane to cut.” He would say, “which you would make believe
    to cut”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_367">P. 367</a>. “Extraordinary.” Beyond the number of his ordinary lemans.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_374">P. 374</a>. “Had I wist.” A proverbial saying, at one time much in fashion
    = had I known. Used here for an uncertainty which turned out an ill
    certainty.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_386">P. 386</a>. “Goeth before.” Takes precedency of.</p>

  <p>——— “Be abroad.” Cf. “Extracts from Wier II.”</p>

  <p>——— “If his cap be on his head.” Cf. “Extracts from Wier II.”</p>

  <p><a href="#p_390">P. 390</a>. “<i>Duratque.</i>” When Dr. Fian was examined, James VI being
    present, he, after the two torturings of the rope, and boots,
    confessed, among other things, that he had bewitched a gentleman—a
    rival lover—and “caused the sade Gentleman that once in xxiiii howers
    he fell into a lunacie and madnes and so continued one hower together”.
    The gentleman was brought before the king, and went violently mad for
    an hour, leaping so high that he touched the ceiling with his head, and
    behaving so violently that the gentlemen present had to get assistance
    and bind him hand and foot. Fian became penitent, and renounced the
    devil; next day said the devil had appeared and would again have
    persuaded him, but he resisted him. However, he, Fian, obtained the key
    of his prison door and fled. Re-captured, he denied all his confession,
    saying that he had only made it through fear of torture. Then “His
    nailes upon all his fingers were riven and pulled out with ... a payre
    of pincers, and under everie naile there was thrust in two needels over
    even up to the heads. [Here, I presume, there is a hysteron proteron.]
    Then was he ... convaied again to the torment of the bootes wherein
    he continued a long time, and did abide, so many blowes in them, that
    his legges were crusht and beaten together as small as might bee, and
    the bones and flesh so brused, that the bloud and <i>marrow</i> spouted
    forth in great abundance, wherby they were made unserviceable for
    ever,” he still declaring that what he had said before “was onely done
    and said for feare of paynes which he had endured”. He was strangled,
    and his body burnt, according to law, towards the end of Jan. 1591.
    The italicising is mine. Can anyone read this without a shudder, and
    without feelings of indignation that will express themselves?</p>

  <p>The gentleman who went mad for an hour, and then said he had been in a
    sound sleep, doubtless acted a part to confirm the tale of his friend.
    This is confirmed by the fact that, violently as he behaved, he seems
    to have hurt no one, not even himself.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_406">P. 406</a>. “Common copulation.” Used as “friendly conjunction” or working
    together, in opposition to “carnal copulation”, a phrase he employs
    when necessary.</p>

  <p>——— “To whome be honour.” Is there an omission here of (as
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">577</span> seems
    most likely) “In the name”, etc., or are we to look back as far as
    “Tetragrammaton”, etc., for antecedents? a course in which I cannot
    myself believe.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_413">P. 413</a>. “My verie name.” Cf. App. II, p. 60, § 22, though I know not
    that this phrase is there explained, we may conjecture from it that we
    have, while alive, spiritual “names after a Magical manner”, whatever
    that may mean.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_414">P. 414</a>. “ffalaur” (Diagram). If one were really wanted, a most
    excellent example—whether we look to Scot’s other uses of this word, or
    to the names of the other three spirits in the diagram—that “ff” was
    merely “F”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_416">P. 416</a>. “Ps. xxii and li.” Prayer Book numbers and version.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_418">P. 418</a>. “Are written in this booke.” It is clear, therefore, that Scot
    took this experiment of Bealphares, and in all probability from ch. 8
    inclusive to this one, from some conjuring book, not improbably T. R.’s.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_419">P. 419</a>. “<i>In throno.</i>” Neither this nor its English equivalent is
    to be found in any of these conjurations. In p. 417 we have, “which
    conteinest the throne of heaven”; but unless the true translation be
    “which are conteined in the throne of the heavens”, this cannot be “in
    throno”. On the whole, I think that it refers to some conjuration not
    copied by Scot, thus strengthening the supposition set forth under
    Extracts from Wier II, and p. 418.</p>

  <p>——— “Then say <i>In throno</i>.” I feel by no means content with the change
    of “then” to “thou”. “And” may be an = “if”, but I do not remember an
    instance of Scot’s use of “and” in this sense. Or this “and” may be an
    accidental insertion by the printer, when after “<i>throno</i>” we might
    understand [adding] “that thou depart”, etc.; and this, I suspect, is
    the sense intended, whatever the emendation may be.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_421">P. 421</a>. “Ch. xv.” The making of the holy water is the Latin form
    of that Englished from the Missal at p. 445. Hence, I presume, the
    blessing of the salt is from the same.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_423">P. 423</a>. “In such a place N.” There being no (,) N. seems here to be
    used for any place, as it has been used for any man or spirit. So
    “this N.”, p. 424, refers to a bond or document. In pp. 425-6, where
    “N.” occurs four times, it can, so far as I can see, mean nothing else
    but the place, the crystal or other matter, in which the spirit is to
    appear. In p. 428, we have also “to your N.”, explained just afterwards
    as “into your christall stone, glasse”, etc. And in p. 429, “anie N.” =
    gold, silver, etc. “N.” was therefore a general indefinite, not used,
    as now, for a man only; still, its most likely etymon seems to be the
    initial of “Nomen”.</p>

  <p>——— “On thy booke.” In 424 we have “by the holie contents in this
    booke”, and “kisse the booke”. From these, and from the statements in
    the additions to the third edition that the conjuror is to consecrate
    and take a Bible with him, I presume, that one is here meant to be used.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_425">P. 425</a>. “Other bond.” That, I presume, which follows on this page.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">578</span></p>

  <p><a href="#p_425">P. 425</a>. “Made a man for ever.” I note this 1584 use of the phrase.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_426">P. 426</a>. “I constreine the spirit of N.” The after text might induce
    one to suppose that “the” = thee, but the phrase is repeated seventeen
    times in this chapter, and “thee spirit of N.” not once, though we have
    “the spirit of thee N.” once, and “thou spirits of N.” thrice. Our
    Elizabethan ancestors were apt thus to mingle up the second and third
    persons.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_428">P. 428</a>. “Proove this.” Try it; put it to the proof.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_431">P. 431</a>. “(Blew miracles).” A friend suggests “trew”; but though this is
    probably the sense, yet I hesitate to change the word. W. B., in <i>Notes
    and Queries</i>, fully explains this as “<i>blaues wunder</i>”, an “amazing
    or wonderful wonder”, the adjective being intensative, as is perhaps
    “blue” in the phrase, “once in a blue moon,” <i>i.e.</i>, never.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_434">P. 434</a>. “Doctor Burc.” The Burcot cozened into buying a familiar from
    Feats, p. 522.</p>

  <p>——— “He strake.” Spirit-rapping, therefore, is older than this century,
    though the manner was different.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_436">P. 436</a>. “Matins at midnight.” The Franciscans solemnise matins directly
    midnight is passed.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_437">P. 437</a>. “Officiall.” The French name. Cf. Cotgrave and Du Cange.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_439">P. 439</a>. “To to abridge.” A printer’s repetition; one being at the end
    of a line, the second at the beginning of the next.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_441">P. 441</a>. “<i>Deus in adjutorium.</i>” Ps. lxx. Prayer Book.</p>

  <p>——— “Excommunicate.” 479. “Infatuate.” The form originated <i>circa</i> 1400,
    from “infatuatus”, etc., before the verbs existed, and are not examples
    of “ed” eliding or coalescing when the verb ends in “d” or “t”. This
    last, however, is found in Scot, and in a work at least ten years older.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_442">P. 442</a>. “Vitas.” See note 87. 458. Ditto.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_444">P. 444</a>. “Except in a plaie.” Probably, therefore, had witnessed
    Moralities, etc.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_446">P. 446</a>. “Increase.” Error for “incense”. <i>Tobit</i> viii, 5. (W. A.
    Harrison.) Vulg. has no word for this in viii, 2; “Fumus”, in vi, 8.
    Genevan version, “perfume”. Whether “incense” be Scot’s own word, or
    the rendering of some English version, I know not.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_459">P. 459</a>. “Sunne ... is 3966000.” The nearest to this computation that I
    can find is that of Archimedes, who made the sun’s distance 1,160 times
    the earth’s semi-diameter, that is, 3,985,760 miles. Scot, however,
    must have taken some later computation, as he speaks of the sun’s
    “neerest” distance.</p>

  <p>——— Note, a pound of good candles, such as were offered in church, cost
    threepence.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_461">P. 461</a>. “Sir John” = the aforesaid priest. Cf. 265, 361, and “Sir
    Lucian”, 463; also 468, the translation of “Dominus”.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_466">P. 466</a>. “Kings bench.” Note, still so called in 1583.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_467">P. 467</a>. “Most noble and vertuous personage.” Probably Leicester. Cf.
    close of letter.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_468">P. 468</a>. “Sir John Malborne,” 1384. Hence an Englishman, and not a
    German, was in all probability the first to raise his voice against the
    cozenages of mediæval witchcraft.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">579</span></p>

  <p><a href="#p_471">P. 471</a>. “Collen.” Cologne.</p>

  <p><a href="#p_474">P. 474</a>. “Three images.” As pointed to by the text, it appears from
    Bodin that, “Un Prestre Sorcier curé d’Istincton [Islington] demi
    lieuë pres de Londres, a esté trouvé saisis 1578 de trois images de
    cire conjurées, pour faire mourir la Reyne d’Angleterre, &amp; deux autres
    proches de sa personne.”</p>

  <p><a href="#p_476">P. 476</a>. “Wherein a Gods name.” = Wherein in God’s name. No oath, but he
    means to explain that the miracle consisted in his being able to read
    the canonical scriptures written in God’s name, or inspired by Him, but
    not the fabulous Apocrypha.</p>

  <p>——— “The good speed.” See note, p. 24.</p>

    <li><i>Abrenunciation</i>, <a href="#p_440">440</a>. A word used probably, as Richardson suggests,

    <li><i>Aqua composita</i>, <a href="#p_316">316</a>. See note.</li>

    <li><i>Astonnied</i>, <a href="#p_309">309</a>. Astonished in the original sense, <i>i.e.</i>, astounded,
      or so lying in a swoon, that she lay as dead.</li>

    <li><i>Avoid</i>, <a href="#p_240">240</a>, <a href="#p_493">493</a>. To void or empty, either “make void” or “void from”.
      This use is as early at least as Trevisa, or <i>circa</i> 1397.</li>

    <li><i>Axes</i>, <a href="#p_232">232</a>. The French <i>Accès</i>. Hence in Sussex and the North = agues.

  </ul>

  <p class="center mb1">B.</p>

    <li><i>Baggage tode</i>, <a href="#p_377">377</a>. A foul tode. The epithet is now only used of an
      ill-conditioned woman of low degree.</li>

    <li><i>Bat</i>, <a href="#p_380">380</a>. A staff.</li>

    <li><i>Bedstaffe</i>, <a href="#p_79">79</a>. The Johnson-Nares explanation is, I believe, wrong.
      With Miss Emma Phipson, I rather take it to be a staff to summon
      attendance, a substitute for the modern bell still
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">581</span> used by invalids
      and others. Cf. <i>Ev. M. in his Humour</i>, i, 4. It has been also
      suggested that it is the staff used to beat up the bed, etc.</li>

    <li><i>Become.</i> Used as then in <a href="#p_126">126</a>, <a href="#p_158">158</a>, <a href="#p_323">323</a>, <a href="#p_329">329</a>, as equivalent to “gone
      to”. Cf. 3 <i>Henry VI</i>, ii, 1, 9, 10. And in a law of Henry VIII (ann.
      33, ch. 8) are the words “where things lost or stolen should be
      become”, when it speaks of the acts of magicians, fortune-tellers, etc.</li>

    <li><i>Beetle-head</i>, <a href="#p_66">66</a>. = Our hammer-headed fellow, a beetle being such a
      hammer or rammer as paviors now use and so call.</li>

    <li><i>Bench whistlers</i>, <a href="#p_528">528</a>. Idle, sottish fellows, who spend their time on
      ale-benches rather than seek occupation, and whistling from want of
      thought or occupation. A then-known phrase.</li>

    <li><i>Bewraieth</i>, <a href="#p_69">69</a>, and frequent. Betray. Also, though a different word
      and not in Scot, to befoul. In <a href="#p_328">328</a> the verb is used thus: “the thing
      shall be so well and perfectly done, that a stranger, though he handle
      it, shall not bewraie it” [<i>i.e.</i>, discover the fraud either to himself
      or others].</li>

    <li><i>Biggin</i>, <a href="#p_471">471</a>. Fr. <i>béguin</i>. Cf. Cotgrave. Properly, according to
      Minsheu, a child’s [close] covering for the head or cap. Also generally
      a close or skull cap; here, as in Sh., 2 <i>Henry IV</i>, iv, 4, used for a
      night-cap.</li>

    <li><i>Bile</i>, <a href="#p_203">203</a>. A boil.</li>

    <li><i>Blisse</i>, <a href="#p_157">157</a>, <i>ad fin.</i> Being opposed to “cursse” seems = blessing.</li>

    <li><i>Boolted</i>, <a href="#p_480">480</a>. A miller’s, etc. technical for sifted.</li>

    <li><i>Bowt</i>, <a href="#p_337">337</a>, <a href="#p_347">347</a>. This (or bout) and bight are still nautical for the
      bending, or loop, of a rope. Scot uses it for the loop, or bending, of
      any thing.</li>

    <li><i>Bowze</i>, <a href="#p_268">268</a>. Boughs.</li>

    <li><i>Bucklers, laie down the</i>, <a href="#p_A_iii"><i>A</i> iii.</a> Submit, own themselves defeated.
      The origin of this and similar phrases is unknown. From the words
      “Clypeus salvus in Cic.” and “Clypeum abjicere”, it may be from the
      usages of classic times,—or it may be mediæval.</li>

    <li><i>Bugges</i>, <a href="#p_288">288</a>. Frightful and unnatural appearances, as in bugbears, a
      now equivalent word.</li>

    <li><i>Bulbeggers</i>, <a href="#p_B_ii"><i>B</i> 2.</a> Terrifying goblins. I see no difficulty in the
      derivation from <i>Bul</i>, a bull, or bull’s face, it being terrifying
      enough, especially when, enraged or mad, it is directly opposed to you;
      and a bulbegger is an over-bold beggar, etc.</li>

    <li><i>Bum card.</i> I believe a card slightly longer or wider than the rest, so
      that the trickster, etc., may distinguish it.</li>

    <li><i>Bum leaf.</i> A leaf similarly distinguished.</li>

    <li><i>By and by</i>, <a href="#p_460">460</a>. Immediately. Elsewhere he thus translates Wier’s
      “mox” and “statim”.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="center mb1">C.</p>

  <ul class="lefthang plain">
    <li><i>Carter</i>, <a href="#p_478">478</a>. Used, as in “carter’s logic”, for a dull-witted
      ignoramus, much in the sense in which we depreciatingly use
      costermonger. Carter’s logic is not the logic of physical persuasion,
      but the ergo of the first gravedigger in <i>Hamlet</i>.</li>

    <li><i>Castrell</i>, <a href="#p_302">302</a>. Kestrel, Tinunculus. The hovering hawk, a wild kind
      not tamable, that frightens other hawks (possibly by its loud, ringing
      voice), and whose effigy was placed near doves, etc., to deter other
      hawks. Hence, probably, arose the fable spoken of in the text.</li>

    <li><i>Cautelousness</i>, <a href="#p_469">469</a>. Artful caution.</li>

    <li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">582</span>
      <i>Censure</i>, <a href="#p_A_viii"><i>A</i> viii.</a> Sentence, or judgment.</li>

    <li><i>Chapman</i>, <a href="#p_485">485</a>. Generally the seller, but also, as here, the buyer; he
      that chaps or cheapens.</li>

    <li><i>Choine cough</i>, <a href="#p_211">211</a>. Chin-cough, the hooping-cough.</li>

    <li><i>Choler</i>, <a href="#p_205">205</a>. One of the supposed four humours. The compound humour
      generated in the liver was divided into two parts, one going to the
      blood, the other to the gall, as this choler or bile. It differed from
      melancholy, or black bile, for the reservoir of this was the spleen.
      Cf. <i>Batman on Barth.</i>, iv, 10, and v, 39.</li>

    <li><i>Circumstance</i>, <a href="#p_24">24</a>. Elsewhere, as <a href="#p_75">75</a>, used for round-about or
      superfluous means. Here it has a greater ill-meaning—a round-about
      statement that would evade declaring the truth.</li>

    <li><i>Clam</i>, <a href="#p_208">208</a>. To stick on; various dialects.</li>

    <li><i>Claweth</i>, <a href="#p_67">67</a>. Scratcheth (where he itcheth), pleaseth, and therefore
      flattereth. Cf. the proverb, “Claw me, claw thee”, or “K. me, K. thee”,
      a polite abbreviation, which, I think, betokens the odious origin of
      the phrase.</li>

    <li><i>Clubhutchins</i>, <a href="#p_372">372</a>. Old Kentish, now, I believe, almost obsolete, for
      a plain, rough countryman.</li>

    <li><i>Coate card</i>, <a href="#p_335">335</a>. Our court card.</li>

    <li><i>Cold prophet</i>, <a href="#p_B_ii_v"><i>B</i> ii. v.</a> <a href="#p_170">170</a>. One whose prophecies are far from the
      mark, just as children at play are hot or cold, when near or far from
      the thing sought. Others say that cold, as in Chaucer = col.</li>

    <li><i>Commend</i>, <a href="#p_134">134</a>. Commit to, in the sense of giving, entrusting, or
      setting forth for his examination. Latinate.</li>

    <li><i>Complexion</i>, <a href="#p_461">461</a>. The four complexions or dispositions were supposed
      to be due to the excess of (1) blood, (2) phlegm, (3) choler, (4)
      melancholy. Here it is used more generally for disposition.</li>

    <li><i>Compline</i>, <a href="#p_393">393</a>. Part of the Romish even-song (Cotgrave), which, said

    <li><i>Confirmed</i>, <a href="#p_429">429</a>. Apparently “made firm”; placed or stationed together,
      each in his fixed place.</li>

    <li><i>Constellation.</i> Is sometimes used in old books, seemingly as denoting
      the co-ordination or coposition of the heavenly bodies (as regards one
      another) at any particular time. It was from these constellations that
      nativities were calculated.</li>

    <li><i>Constreineth.</i> In its primary or literal sense of drawn together.</li>

    <li><i>Countrie</i>, <a href="#p_A_iiii"><i>A</i> iiii.</a> Used, as occasionally then, for county.</li>

    <li><i>Cousen</i>, <a href="#p_A_vii_v"><i>A</i> vii. v.</a> Used then as a term implying relationship of any

    <li><i>Crosse of a coin</i>, <a href="#p_388">388</a>. The reverse
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">583</span> bore a cross. Now called the tail
      in “heads or tails”.</li>

    <li><i>Curious</i>, <a href="#p_333">333</a>. As frequently in those days, “curiosus”, full of care,
      careful; those who would inquire carefully or curiously into the matter.</li>

    <li><i>Cushion, missed the</i>, <a href="#p_490">490</a>. Nares says it evidently alludes to archery:
      an unsupported guess, and not, I think, a probable one. More likely the
      reference is to some game, such as a variant of stool ball, or possibly
      to the cushion dance. Or it may simply mean missed his seat.</li>

    <li><i>Dismembred</i>, <a href="#p_313">313</a>. There being no talk of the members of an animal
      being taken away, I take it that he means diversely membered from what
      it was naturally, as was the serpent with “manie legs”.</li>

    <li><i>Dizzards</i>, <a href="#p_291">291</a>. Evidently fool or blockhead. That it was a name for
      the vice or fool of a play is by no means a proof of its prater or
      diseur origin, for he was not so much a prater as a funny lout who bore
      himself apishly, and “moved his body as him list”. Rather cognate to
      dizzy.</li>

    <li><i>Donee</i>, <a href="#p_148">148</a>. Noted as an early use of the word.</li>

    <li><i>Doubt in</i>, <a href="#p_482">482</a>; <i>doubted</i>, <a href="#p_6">6</a>. Two excellent examples of the then
      frequent use of these words for fear and feared.</li>

    <li><i>Duplex s. s.</i>, <a href="#p_282">282</a>. Should have been duplicis, but the writer probably

      of him and his works.</li>

      for it, calling them eye biting witches” (<i>A Candle in the Dark</i>, by

    <li><i>Foreslowed</i>, <a href="#p_365">365</a>. Slowed overmuch, <i>i.e.</i>, omitted at times. So we
      have other words in fore—foregrown, etc. <i>Forespoken</i>, has been said to
      be a compound of our fore, meaning bespeak or predict (Rich.). But it
      is not to predict, but to do. Hence, I rather take it as equal to speak
      over-much against, <i>i.e.</i>, bewitch.</li>

    <li><i>Frote</i> (A. N.). To rub.</li>
  </ul>

    <li><i>Graffing</i>, <a href="#p_290">290</a>. A form, an older form, of “grafting”, and so the verb
      graff.</li>

    <li><i>Griphes</i>, <a href="#p_202">202</a>. Vultures here, though in some authors it is the griffin
      or dragon.</li>

    <li><i>Gudgins</i>, <a href="#p_257">257</a>. Gudgeons. This fish is a bait, and is easily caught.
      From this latter circumstance it is here, as frequently, and as in
      Shakespeare, used for a fool.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="center mb1">H.</p>

  <ul class="lefthang plain">
    <li><i>Hagging, went to</i>, <a href="#p_25">25</a>. I suppose went to perform her part or duty as
      a witch. From hag-ridden, hag-tracks, and hag-worn, hag seems to have
      been used as a synonyme for wicked or witch.</li>

    <li><i>Haggister</i>, <a href="#p_82">82</a>. Kentish for the magpie.</li>

    <li><i>Hailed</i>, <a href="#p_196">196</a>. Haled, hauled.</li>

    <li><i>Hair, against the</i>, <a href="#p_9">9</a>. Contrary to the inclination, a phrase which
      might readily be drawn as to other animals, but which, I think, arose
      from dressing a horse.</li>

    <li><i>Hair, hang her up by the</i>, <a href="#p_257">257</a>. Seems from the word “utterly” to have
      been used metaphorically for make away with. Perhaps because Absalom
      was, and is popularly supposed to have so died; or possibly from this
      it was a civiller synonyme for being hung.</li>

    <li><i>Hallowe</i>, <a href="#p_316">316</a>. Hollow.</li>

    <li><i>Handle</i>, <a href="#p_368">368</a>. Used in one instance for to go about, or carry on, in a
      good sense; in the second, as to make a passive instrument of, as the
      monkey when he used the cat’s paw for the hot chestnuts.</li>

    <li><i>Heeles, by the</i>, <a href="#p_65">65</a>. Arrested and confined him, because offenders were

      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">585</span> as bodily
      chastity. We still speak in this sense of an “honest woman”.</li>

    <li><i>Hot</i>, <a href="#p_255">255</a>. Preterite of hit. An old, and also frequent, Kentish form
      of the past in many verbs.</li>

    <li><i>Houseled, be</i>, <a href="#p_265">265</a>. Receive the Eucharist.</li>

    <li><i>Hugger mugger</i>, <a href="#p_433">433</a>. An early example, explained by “secretlie”; but
      it also means, I think, as a consequence of the secrecy, in a hurried,
      tumbling, indecorous fashion.</li>

    <li><i>Hundreth</i>, <a href="#p_338">338</a>. A then common variant for hundred.</li>

    <li><i>Jetting, a</i>, <a href="#p_265">265</a>. Jet, to fling, strut, etc., from the Fr. <i>jeter</i>,
      and though I have not found a similar phrase, it seems here used in the
      sense of having a fling, or a spree.</li>

    <li><i>John, Sir</i>, <a href="#p_265">265</a>. Cf. note.</li>

    <li><i>Jollie</i>, <a href="#p_197">197</a>, <a href="#p_273">273</a>. We find its use in Scot, explaining, as it were,
      how the French <i>joli</i>, pretty, became our jolly, as in the phrase, “a
      pretty fellow”. Sometimes, as in the last phrase, it seems to have a
      somewhat lowering sense. In 273 he seems called jollie because he drank.</li>

    <li><i>Jumpe with</i>, <a href="#p_492">492</a>. Equally or exactly with.</li>

      ignorant; sometimes in a similar sense as lay, opposed to clerkly or
      learned; sometimes wicked or nefarious. Lewdness, in <a href="#p_8">8</a>, seems to equal
      uselessness, or doing nothing for their living.</li>

      appointed.</li>

    <li><i>Loose</i>, <i>lose</i>. These spellings are used interchangeably in this work,

      Cotgrave, Baret, etc. Grand-child is used by Cotgrave, but hardly

    <li><i>Orient</i>, <a href="#p_297">297</a>. This word was then oddly used. An orient pearl was so
      called by the Romans because it was large, and large pearls generally
      came from the East. So here, easterly seems to be used as an equivalent
      for hot. The eastern regions being in his astronomy nearer the sun’s
      rising, they were hotter,—a false explanation of a true fact.</li>

  <p>The extreme rarity of this work, and the great interest taken in it
    by connoisseurs, has suggested to the publisher the advisability of
    producing a facsimile reprint for the use of those Collectors and
    Anglers who can never hope to possess the almost priceless original.
    The present facsimile is reproduced from a copy of the original edition
    in the British Museum, by means of photography, and consequently
    renders every peculiarity of the original in faithful detail: the
    rude Illustrations which adorned the first edition of this “lytyll
    plaunflet” are here given in all their quaint roughness. The work is
    printed on hand-made paper of the same texture and colour as that on
    which the first edition appeared, and the binding is of contemporary
    pattern and material, so that the reader of to-day in handling this
    volume can realise the form and appearance of the original, which must
    have delighted the eyes of those who studied “treatyses perteynynge to
    dyuers playsaunt matters belongynge vnto noblesse.”</p>

  <p class="center">Written by JOHN SKELTON, Poet Laureate to King Henry VIII. Reproduced

    <span class="smcap">John Ashton</span>.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Ballade of the Scottysshe Kynge</span> is the earliest known
    printed English ballad; it was discovered under curious and interesting
    circumstances, which are narrated in detail in the Introduction,
    and is here very carefully facsimiled. A limited number of copies
    were issued in a tasteful form for those collectors of ballads and
    connoisseurs of early printing who desire to possess the work in the
    nearest shape to its original form. It is accompanied by an Historical
    and Bibliographical Introduction, giving an account of the various
    printed forms of the incidents it records, with Illustrative Quotations
    from the more important of them; also Notes from Contemporary History,
    elucidating the events of the Ballad, and other information interesting
    to the Antiquary and the Bibliographer.</p>
